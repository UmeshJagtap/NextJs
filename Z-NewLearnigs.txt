Basics :--

Q. diferrence between let const var

var: Has function scope or global scope. Variables declared with var are accessible throughout the entire function they are declared in, or globally if declared outside any function.
let: Has block scope. Variables declared with let are only accessible within the block (code enclosed in curly braces {}) in which they are defined. 
(Eg. if statements, else statements, for loops, while loops, switch statements, { let x = 10; })
const: Also has block scope, similar to let.

var: Allows both reassignment (changing the value) and redeclaration (declaring the variable again in the same scope).
let: Allows reassignment but not redeclaration within the same block scope.
const: Does not allow reassignment after its initial assignment. However, if a const variable holds an object or array, the properties of that object or array can still be modified (mutated). 
       const also does not allow redeclaration within the same block scope.

Q. what happens if you do not pass any depedency array to useEffect 
>> The useEffect will be called every time any state of the component changes
>> Empty array ([]): The effect runs only once after the initial render
>> Array with dependencies ([dep1, dep2]): The effect runs after the initial render and whenever any of the specified dependencies change. 
   This ensures the effect re-runs only when necessary, optimizing performance. 

Q. Higher Order Functions 
>> Higher order functions are functions that take one or more functions as arguments, or return a function as their result.
   filter(), map(), reduce()
   A Higher-Order Component (HOC) is a function that takes a component as an argument and returns a new, "enhanced" component.
   This new component typically wraps the original component, adding props, state, or behavior without directly modifying the original component's code. 
      Key Characteristics and Use Cases: Code Reusability, Cross-Cutting Concerns (Authentication, Data Fetching, Styling/Theming, Logging)
      Eg: Imagine a withLoading HOC that adds a loading indicator while data is being fetched: Eg2. useSanitizedClasses()

Hooks 

useTransition :- 
useTransition is a React Hook that lets you render a part of the UI in the background.
const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition()

useId
useId is a React Hook for generating unique IDs that can be passed to accessibility attributes.
const id = useId()

useLayoutEffect
useLayoutEffect is a version of useEffect that fires before the browser repaints the screen.
Pitfall
useLayoutEffect can hurt performance. Prefer useEffect when possible.

React LifeCycle Methods :- 
Mounting Phase (Component is being created and inserted into the DOM)
Updating Phase (Component is being re-rendered due to changes in props or state)
Unmounting Phase (Component is being removed from the DOM)
useEffect can be used to mimic componentDidMount,
