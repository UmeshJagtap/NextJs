Chapter 11 
Adding Search and Pagination

In the previous chapter, you improved your dashboard's initial loading performance with streaming. Now let's move on to the /invoices page, and learn how to add search and pagination!

Starting code ------> 
Inside your /dashboard/invoices/page.tsx file, paste the following code:

/app/dashboard/invoices/page.tsx
import Pagination from '@/app/ui/invoices/pagination';
import Search from '@/app/ui/search';
import Table from '@/app/ui/invoices/table';
import { CreateInvoice } from '@/app/ui/invoices/buttons';
import { lusitana } from '@/app/ui/fonts';
import { InvoicesTableSkeleton } from '@/app/ui/skeletons';
import { Suspense } from 'react';
 
export default async function Page() {
  return (
    <div className="w-full">
      <div className="flex w-full items-center justify-between">
        <h1 className={`${lusitana.className} text-2xl`}>Invoices</h1>
      </div>
      <div className="mt-4 flex items-center justify-between gap-2 md:mt-8">
        <Search placeholder="Search invoices..." />
        <CreateInvoice />
      </div>
      {/*  <Suspense key={query + currentPage} fallback={<InvoicesTableSkeleton />}>
        <Table query={query} currentPage={currentPage} />
      </Suspense> */}
      <div className="mt-5 flex w-full justify-center">
        {/* <Pagination totalPages={totalPages} /> */}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}


Spend some time familiarizing yourself with the page and the components you'll be working with:

1. <Search/> allows users to search for specific invoices.
2. <Pagination/> allows users to navigate between pages of invoices.
3. <Table/> displays the invoices.

Your search functionality will span the client and the server. When a user searches for an invoice on the client, the URL params will be updated, data will be fetched on the server, and the table will re-render on the server with the new data.

Why use URL search params? ------>

As mentioned above, you'll be using URL search params to manage the search state. This pattern may be new if you're used to doing it with client side state.

There are a couple of benefits of implementing search with URL params:

* Bookmarkable and Shareable URLs: Since the search parameters are in the URL, users can bookmark the current state of the application, including their search queries and filters, for future reference or sharing.
* Server-Side Rendering and Initial Load: URL parameters can be directly consumed on the server to render the initial state, making it easier to handle server rendering.
* Analytics and Tracking: Having search queries and filters directly in the URL makes it easier to track user behavior without requiring additional client-side logic.

Adding the search functionality ------>

These are the Next.js client hooks that you'll use to implement the search functionality:

* useSearchParams- Allows you to access the parameters of the current URL. For example, the search params for this URL /dashboard/invoices?page=1&query=pending would look like this: {page: '1', query: 'pending'}.
* usePathname - Lets you read the current URL's pathname. For example, for the route /dashboard/invoices, usePathname would return '/dashboard/invoices'.
* useRouter - Enables navigation between routes within client components programmatically. There are multiple methods you can use.

Here's a quick overview of the implementation steps:

1. Capture the user's input.
2. Update the URL with the search params.
3. Keep the URL in sync with the input field.
4. Update the table to reflect the search query.

1. Capture the user's input  ------>

Go into the <Search> Component (/app/ui/search.tsx), and you'll notice:

* "use client" - This is a Client Component, which means you can use event listeners and hooks.
* <input> - This is the search input.

Create a new handleSearch function, and add an onChange listener to the <input> element. onChange will invoke handleSearch whenever the input value changes.

/app/ui/search.tsx

'use client';
 
import { MagnifyingGlassIcon } from '@heroicons/react/24/outline';
 
export default function Search({ placeholder }: { placeholder: string }) {
**  function handleSearch(term: string) {
**    console.log(term);
**  }
 
  return (
    <div className="relative flex flex-1 flex-shrink-0">
      <label htmlFor="search" className="sr-only">
        Search
      </label>
      <input
        className="peer block w-full rounded-md border border-gray-200 py-[9px] pl-10 text-sm outline-2 placeholder:text-gray-500"
        placeholder={placeholder}
**        onChange={(e) => {
**          handleSearch(e.target.value);
**        }}
      />
      <MagnifyingGlassIcon className="absolute left-3 top-1/2 h-[18px] w-[18px] -translate-y-1/2 text-gray-500 peer-focus:text-gray-900" />
    </div>
  );
}

Test that it's working correctly by opening the console in your Developer Tools, then type into the search field. You should see the search term logged to the console.

Great! You're capturing the user's search input. Now, you need to update the URL with the search term.

2. Update the URL with the search params  ------>

Import the useSearchParams hook from 'next/navigation', and assign it to a variable:

/app/ui/search.tsx
'use client';
 
import { MagnifyingGlassIcon } from '@heroicons/react/24/outline';
** import { useSearchParams } from 'next/navigation';
 
export default function Search() {
**  const searchParams = useSearchParams();
 
  function handleSearch(term: string) {
    console.log(term);
  }
  // ...
}

Inside handleSearch, create a new URLSearchParams -https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URLSearchParams instance using your new searchParams variable.

/app/ui/search.tsx
'use client';
 
import { MagnifyingGlassIcon } from '@heroicons/react/24/outline';
import { useSearchParams } from 'next/navigation';
 
export default function Search() {
  const searchParams = useSearchParams();
 
  function handleSearch(term: string) {
**    const params = new URLSearchParams(searchParams);
  }
  // ...
}

URLSearchParams is a Web API that provides utility methods for manipulating the URL query parameters. Instead of creating a complex string literal, you can use it to get the params string like ?page=1&query=a.

Next, set the params string based on the user’s input. If the input is empty, you want to delete it:

/app/ui/search.tsx
'use client';
 
import { MagnifyingGlassIcon } from '@heroicons/react/24/outline';
import { useSearchParams } from 'next/navigation';
 
export default function Search() {
  const searchParams = useSearchParams();
 
  function handleSearch(term: string) {
    const params = new URLSearchParams(searchParams);
    if (term) {
      params.set('query', term);
    } else {
      params.delete('query');
    }
  }
  // ...
}

Now that you have the query string. You can use Next.js's useRouter and usePathname hooks to update the URL.

Import useRouter and usePathname from 'next/navigation', and use the replace method from useRouter() inside handleSearch:

/app/ui/search.tsx
'use client';
 
import { MagnifyingGlassIcon } from '@heroicons/react/24/outline';
** import { useSearchParams, usePathname, useRouter } from 'next/navigation';
 
export default function Search() {
  const searchParams = useSearchParams();
**  const pathname = usePathname();
**  const { replace } = useRouter();
 
  function handleSearch(term: string) {
    const params = new URLSearchParams(searchParams);
    if (term) {
      params.set('query', term);
    } else {
      params.delete('query');
    }
**    replace(`${pathname}?${params.toString()}`);
  }
}

Here's a breakdown of what's happening:

* ${pathname} is the current path, in your case, "/dashboard/invoices".
* As the user types into the search bar, params.toString() translates this input into a URL-friendly format.
* replace(${pathname}?${params.toString()}) updates the URL with the user's search data. For example, /dashboard/invoices?query=lee if the user searches for "Lee".
* The URL is updated without reloading the page, thanks to Next.js's client-side navigation (which you learned about in the chapter on navigating between pages.

3. Keeping the URL and input in sync  ------>

To ensure the input field is in sync with the URL and will be populated when sharing, you can pass a defaultValue to input by reading from searchParams:

/app/ui/search.tsx
<input
  className="peer block w-full rounded-md border border-gray-200 py-[9px] pl-10 text-sm outline-2 placeholder:text-gray-500"
  placeholder={placeholder}
  onChange={(e) => {
    handleSearch(e.target.value);
  }}
  defaultValue={searchParams.get('query')?.toString()}
/>

defaultValue vs. value / Controlled vs. Uncontrolled

If you're using state to manage the value of an input, you'd use the value attribute to make it a controlled component. This means React would manage the input's state.

However, since you're not using state, you can use defaultValue. This means the native input will manage its own state. This is okay since you're saving the search query to the URL instead of state.

4. Updating the table  ------>

Finally, you need to update the table component to reflect the search query.

Navigate back to the invoices page.

Page components accept a prop called searchParams, so you can pass the current URL params to the <Table> component.

/app/dashboard/invoices/page.tsx
import Pagination from '@/app/ui/invoices/pagination';
import Search from '@/app/ui/search';
import Table from '@/app/ui/invoices/table';
import { CreateInvoice } from '@/app/ui/invoices/buttons';
import { lusitana } from '@/app/ui/fonts';
import { Suspense } from 'react';
import { InvoicesTableSkeleton } from '@/app/ui/skeletons';
 
** export default async function Page({
**   searchParams,
** }: {
**   searchParams?: {
**     query?: string;
**     page?: string;
**    };
** }) {
**   const query = searchParams?.query || '';
**   const currentPage = Number(searchParams?.page) || 1;
 
  return (
    <div className="w-full">
      <div className="flex w-full items-center justify-between">
        <h1 className={`${lusitana.className} text-2xl`}>Invoices</h1>
      </div>
      <div className="mt-4 flex items-center justify-between gap-2 md:mt-8">
        <Search placeholder="Search invoices..." />
        <CreateInvoice />
      </div>
**      <Suspense key={query + currentPage} fallback={<InvoicesTableSkeleton />}>
**        <Table query={query} currentPage={currentPage} />
**      </Suspense>
      <div className="mt-5 flex w-full justify-center">
        {/* <Pagination totalPages={totalPages} /> */}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

If you navigate to the <Table> Component, you'll see that the two props, query and currentPage, are passed to the fetchFilteredInvoices() function which returns the invoices that match the query.

/app/ui/invoices/table.tsx
// ...
export default async function InvoicesTable({
  query,
  currentPage,
}: {
  query: string;
  currentPage: number;
}) {
  const invoices = await fetchFilteredInvoices(query, currentPage);
  // ...
}

With these changes in place, go ahead and test it out. If you search for a term, you'll update the URL, which will send a new request to the server, data will be fetched on the server, and only the invoices that match your query will be returned.

When to use the useSearchParams() hook vs. the searchParams prop?

You might have noticed you used two different ways to extract search params. Whether you use one or the other depends on whether you're working on the client or the server.

** <Search> is a Client Component, so you used the useSearchParams() hook to access the params from the client.
** <Table> is a Server Component that fetches its own data, so you can pass the searchParams prop from the page to the component.

As a general rule, if you want to read the params from the client, use the useSearchParams() hook as this avoids having to go back to the server.

Best practice: Debouncing  ------>
Congratulations! You've implemented search with Next.js! But there's something you can do to optimize it.

Inside your handleSearch function, add the following console.log:
/app/ui/search.tsx
function handleSearch(term: string) {
**  console.log(`Searching... ${term}`);
 
  const params = new URLSearchParams(searchParams);
  if (term) {
    params.set('query', term);
  } else {
    params.delete('query');
  }
  replace(`${pathname}?${params.toString()}`);
}

Then type "Emil" into your search bar and check the console in dev tools. What is happening?

Dev Tools Console
Searching... E
Searching... Em
Searching... Emi
Searching... Emil

You're updating the URL on every keystroke, and therefore querying your database on every keystroke! This isn't a problem as our application is small, but imagine if your application had thousands of users, each sending a new request to your database on each keystroke.

Debouncing is a programming practice that limits the rate at which a function can fire. In our case, you only want to query the database when the user has stopped typing.

How Debouncing Works:
1. Trigger Event: When an event that should be debounced (like a keystroke in the search box) occurs, a timer starts.
2. Wait: If a new event occurs before the timer expires, the timer is reset.
3. Execution: If the timer reaches the end of its countdown, the debounced function is executed.

You can implement debouncing in a few ways, including manually creating your own debounce function. To keep things simple, we'll use a library called use-debounce.

Install use-debounce:
Terminal
pnpm i use-debounce

In your <Search> Component, import a function called useDebouncedCallback:

/app/ui/search.tsx
// ...
** import { useDebouncedCallback } from 'use-debounce';
 
// Inside the Search Component...
** const handleSearch = useDebouncedCallback((term) => {
  console.log(`Searching... ${term}`);
 
  const params = new URLSearchParams(searchParams);
  if (term) {
    params.set('query', term);
  } else {
    params.delete('query');
  }
  replace(`${pathname}?${params.toString()}`);
** }, 300);

This function will wrap the contents of handleSearch, and only run the code after a specific time once the user has stopped typing (300ms).

Now type in your search bar again, and open the console in dev tools. You should see the following:

Dev Tools Console
Searching... Emil

By debouncing, you can reduce the number of requests sent to your database, thus saving resources.

Q. What problem does debouncing solve in the search feature?
> It prevents a new database query on every keystroke
E. That's right! Debouncing prevents a new database query on every keystroke, thus saving resources.

Adding pagination  -------> 

After introducing the search feature, you'll notice the table displays only 6 invoices at a time. This is because the fetchFilteredInvoices() function in data.ts returns a maximum of 6 invoices per page.

Adding pagination allows users to navigate through the different pages to view all the invoices. Let's see how you can implement pagination using URL params, just like you did with search.

Navigate to the <Pagination/> component and you'll notice that it's a Client Component. You don't want to fetch data on the client as this would expose your database secrets (remember, you're not using an API layer). Instead, you can fetch the data on the server, and pass it to the component as a prop.

In /dashboard/invoices/page.tsx, import a new function called fetchInvoicesPages and pass the query from searchParams as an argument:

/app/dashboard/invoices/page.tsx
// ...
** import { fetchInvoicesPages } from '@/app/lib/data';
 
export default async function Page({
  searchParams,
}: {
  searchParams?: {
    query?: string,
    page?: string,
  },
}) {
  const query = searchParams?.query || '';
  const currentPage = Number(searchParams?.page) || 1;
 
**  const totalPages = await fetchInvoicesPages(query);
 
  return (
    // ...
  );
}

fetchInvoicesPages returns the total number of pages based on the search query. For example, if there are 12 invoices that match the search query, and each page displays 6 invoices, then the total number of pages would be 2.

Next, pass the totalPages prop to the <Pagination/> component:

/app/dashboard/invoices/page.tsx
// ...
 
export default async function Page({
  searchParams,
}: {
  searchParams?: {
    query?: string;
    page?: string;
  };
}) {
  const query = searchParams?.query || '';
  const currentPage = Number(searchParams?.page) || 1;
 
  const totalPages = await fetchInvoicesPages(query);
 
  return (
    <div className="w-full">
      <div className="flex w-full items-center justify-between">
        <h1 className={`${lusitana.className} text-2xl`}>Invoices</h1>
      </div>
      <div className="mt-4 flex items-center justify-between gap-2 md:mt-8">
        <Search placeholder="Search invoices..." />
        <CreateInvoice />
      </div>
      <Suspense key={query + currentPage} fallback={<InvoicesTableSkeleton />}>
        <Table query={query} currentPage={currentPage} />
      </Suspense>
      <div className="mt-5 flex w-full justify-center">
**        <Pagination totalPages={totalPages} />
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

Navigate to the <Pagination/> component and import the usePathname and useSearchParams hooks. We will use this to get the current page and set the new page. Make sure to also uncomment the code in this component. Your application will break temporarily as you haven't implemented the <Pagination/> logic yet. Let's do that now!

/app/ui/invoices/pagination.tsx
'use client';
 
import { ArrowLeftIcon, ArrowRightIcon } from '@heroicons/react/24/outline';
import clsx from 'clsx';
import Link from 'next/link';
import { generatePagination } from '@/app/lib/utils';
import { usePathname, useSearchParams } from 'next/navigation';
 
export default function Pagination({ totalPages }: { totalPages: number }) {
**  const pathname = usePathname();
**  const searchParams = useSearchParams();
**  const currentPage = Number(searchParams.get('page')) || 1;
 
  // ...
}

Next, create a new function inside the <Pagination> Component called createPageURL. Similarly to the search, you'll use URLSearchParams to set the new page number, and pathName to create the URL string.

/app/ui/invoices/pagination.tsx
'use client';
 
import { ArrowLeftIcon, ArrowRightIcon } from '@heroicons/react/24/outline';
import clsx from 'clsx';
import Link from 'next/link';
import { generatePagination } from '@/app/lib/utils';
import { usePathname, useSearchParams } from 'next/navigation';
 
export default function Pagination({ totalPages }: { totalPages: number }) {
  const pathname = usePathname();
  const searchParams = useSearchParams();
  const currentPage = Number(searchParams.get('page')) || 1;
 
**  const createPageURL = (pageNumber: number | string) => {
**    const params = new URLSearchParams(searchParams);
**    params.set('page', pageNumber.toString());
**    return `${pathname}?${params.toString()}`;
**   };
 
  // ...
}

Here's a breakdown of what's happening:
* createPageURL creates an instance of the current search parameters.
* Then, it updates the "page" parameter to the provided page number.
* Finally, it constructs the full URL using the pathname and updated search parameters.

The rest of the <Pagination> component deals with styling and different states (first, last, active, disabled, etc). We won't go into detail for this course, but feel free to look through the code to see where createPageURL is being called.

Finally, when the user types a new search query, you want to reset the page number to 1. You can do this by updating the handleSearch function in your <Search> component:

/app/ui/search.tsx
'use client';
 
import { MagnifyingGlassIcon } from '@heroicons/react/24/outline';
import { usePathname, useRouter, useSearchParams } from 'next/navigation';
import { useDebouncedCallback } from 'use-debounce';
 
export default function Search({ placeholder }: { placeholder: string }) {
  const searchParams = useSearchParams();
  const { replace } = useRouter();
  const pathname = usePathname();
 
  const handleSearch = useDebouncedCallback((term) => {
    const params = new URLSearchParams(searchParams);
    params.set('page', '1');
    if (term) {
      params.set('query', term);
    } else {
      params.delete('query');
    }
    replace(`${pathname}?${params.toString()}`);
  }, 300);
 

Summary  ------>

Congratulations! You've just implemented search and pagination using URL Params and Next.js APIs.

To summarize, in this chapter:

* You've handled search and pagination with URL search parameters instead of client state.
* You've fetched data on the server.
* You're using the useRouter router hook for smoother, client-side transitions.
These patterns are different from what you may be used to when working with client-side React, but hopefully, you now better understand the benefits of using URL search params and lifting this state to the server.

You've Completed Chapter 11
Your dashboard now has search and pagination functionality!



Chapter 12
Mutating Data


In the previous chapter, you implemented search and pagination using URL Search Params and Next.js APIs. Let's continue working on the Invoices page by adding the ability to create, update, and delete invoices!

Here are the topics we’ll cover
* What React Server Actions are and how to use them to mutate data.
[] How to work with forms and Server Components.
> Best practices for working with the native formData object, including type validation.
() How to revalidate the client cache using the revalidatePath API.
= How to create dynamic route segments with specific IDs.

What are Server Actions?  ------>

React Server Actions allow you to run asynchronous code directly on the server. They eliminate the need to create API endpoints to mutate your data. Instead, you write asynchronous functions that execute on the server and can be invoked from your Client or Server Components.

( In summary, asynchronous programming is an essential concept in JavaScript that allows your code to run in the background without blocking the execution of other code. Developers can create more efficient and responsive applications by using features like callbacks, async/await, and promises. )

Security is a top priority for web applications, as they can be vulnerable to various threats. This is where Server Actions come in. They offer an effective security solution, protecting against different types of attacks, securing your data, and ensuring authorized access. Server Actions achieve this through techniques like POST requests, encrypted closures, strict input checks, error message hashing, and host restrictions, all working together to significantly enhance your app's safety.

Using forms with Server Actions ------>

In React, you can use the action attribute in the <form> element to invoke actions. The action will automatically receive the native FormData object, containing the captured data.

For example:
// Server Component
export default function Page() {
  // Action
  async function create(formData: FormData) {
    'use server';
 
    // Logic to mutate data...
  }
 
  // Invoke the action using the "action" attribute
  return <form action={create}>...</form>;
}

An advantage of invoking a Server Action within a Server Component is progressive enhancement - forms work even if JavaScript is disabled on the client.

Next.js with Server Actions ------>

Server Actions are also deeply integrated with Next.js caching. -https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/caching When a form is submitted through a Server Action, not only can you use the action to mutate data, but you can also revalidate the associated cache using APIs like revalidatePath and revalidateTag.

Q. What's one benefit of using a Server Actions?
> Progressive Enhancement.
E. That's right! This allows users to interact with the form and submit data even if the JavaScript for the form hasn't been loaded yet or if it fails to load.

Let's see how it all works together!

Creating an invoice ------>> 

Here are the steps you'll take to create a new invoice:

1. Create a form to capture the user's input.
2. Create a Server Action and invoke it from the form.
3. Inside your Server Action, extract the data from the formData object.
4. Validate and prepare the data to be inserted into your database.
5. Insert the data and handle any errors.
6. Revalidate the cache and redirect the user back to invoices page.

1. Create a new route and form  ------> 
To start, inside the /invoices folder, add a new route segment called /create with a page.tsx file:

[] invoices   
   [] create
      > page.tsx

You'll be using this route to create new invoices. Inside your page.tsx file, paste the following code, then spend some time studying it:

/dashboard/invoices/create/page.tsx
import Form from '@/app/ui/invoices/create-form';
import Breadcrumbs from '@/app/ui/invoices/breadcrumbs';
import { fetchCustomers } from '@/app/lib/data';
 
export default async function Page() {
  const customers = await fetchCustomers();
 
  return (
    <main>
      <Breadcrumbs
        breadcrumbs={[
          { label: 'Invoices', href: '/dashboard/invoices' },
          {
            label: 'Create Invoice',
            href: '/dashboard/invoices/create',
            active: true,
          },
        ]}
      />
      <Form customers={customers} />
    </main>
  );
}

Your page is a Server Component that fetches customers and passes it to the <Form> component. To save time, we've already created the <Form> component for you.

Navigate to the <Form> component, and you'll see that the form:

* Has one <select> (dropdown) element with a list of customers.
* Has one <input> element for the amount with type="number".
* Has two <input> elements for the status with type="radio".
* Has one button with type="submit".

On http://localhost:3000/dashboard/invoices/create, you should see the following UI:

|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
||-------------------|  Invoices / Create Invoice                           |

2. Create a Server Action  ------> 
Great, now let's create a Server Action that is going to be called when the form is submitted.

Navigate to your lib directory and create a new file named actions.ts. At the top of this file, add the React use server -https://react.dev/reference/react/use-server directive:

/app/lib/actions.ts
'use server';

By adding the 'use server', you mark all the exported functions within the file as Server Actions. These server functions can then be imported and used in Client and Server components.

You can also write Server Actions directly inside Server Components by adding "use server" inside the action. But for this course, we'll keep them all organized in a separate file.

In your actions.ts file, create a new async function that accepts formData:

/app/lib/actions.ts
'use server';

export async function createInvoice(formData: FormData) {}

Then, in your <Form> component, import the createInvoice from your actions.ts file. Add a action attribute to the <form> element, and call the createInvoice action.

/app/ui/invoices/create-form.tsx
import { customerField } from '@/app/lib/definitions';
import Link from 'next/link';
import {
  CheckIcon,
  ClockIcon,
  CurrencyDollarIcon,
  UserCircleIcon,
} from '@heroicons/react/24/outline';
import { Button } from '@/app/ui/button';
** import { createInvoice } from '@/app/lib/actions';
 
export default function Form({
  customers,
}: {
  customers: customerField[];
}) {
  return (
**    <form action={createInvoice}>
      // ...
  )
}

Good to know: In HTML, you'd pass a URL to the action attribute. This URL would be the destination where your form data should be submitted (usually an API endpoint).

However, in React, the action attribute is considered a special prop - meaning React builds on top of it to allow actions to be invoked.

Behind the scenes, Server Actions create a POST API endpoint. This is why you don't need to create API endpoints manually when using Server Actions.

3. Extract the data from formData  ------>

Back in your actions.ts file, you'll need to extract the values of formData, there are a couple of methods you can use. For this example, let's use the .get(name) method.

'use server';
 
** export async function createInvoice(formData: FormData) {
**   const rawFormData = {
**     customerId: formData.get('customerId'),
**     amount: formData.get('amount'),
**     status: formData.get('status'),
**   };
**   // Test it out:
**   console.log(rawFormData);
}

Tip: If you're working with forms that have many fields, you may want to consider using the entries() method with JavaScript's Object.fromEntries(). For example:

const rawFormData = Object.fromEntries(formData.entries())

To check everything is connected correctly, go ahead and try out the form. After submitting, you should see the data you just entered into the form logged in your terminal.

Now that your data is in the shape of an object, it'll be much easier to work with.

4. Validate and prepare the data ------>

Before sending the form data to your database, you want to ensure it's in the correct format and with the correct types. If you remember from earlier in the course, your invoices table expects data in the following format:

/app/lib/definitions.ts
export type Invoice = {
  id: string; // Will be created on the database
  customer_id: string;
  amount: number; // Stored in cents
  status: 'pending' | 'paid';
  date: string;
};

So far, you only have the customer_id, amount, and status from the form.

Type validation and coercion +--+
It's important to validate that the data from your form aligns with the expected types in your database. For instance, if you add a console.log inside your action:

console.log(typeof rawFormData.amount);

You'll notice that amount is of type string and not number. This is because input elements with type="number" actually return a string, not a number!

To handle type validation, you have a few options. While you can manually validate types, using a type validation library can save you time and effort. For your example, we'll use Zod -https://zod.dev/ , a TypeScript-first validation library that can simplify this task for you.

In your actions.ts file, import Zod and define a schema that matches the shape of your form object. This schema will validate the formData before saving it to a database.

/app/lib/actions.ts
'use server';
 
import { z } from 'zod';
 
const FormSchema = z.object({
  id: z.string(),
  customerId: z.string(),
  amount: z.coerce.number(),
  status: z.enum(['pending', 'paid']),
  date: z.string(),
});
 
const CreateInvoice = FormSchema.omit({ id: true, date: true });
 
export async function createInvoice(formData: FormData) {
  // ...
}

The amount field is specifically set to coerce (change) from a string to a number while also validating its type.

You can then pass your rawFormData to CreateInvoice to validate the types:

/app/lib/actions.ts
// ...
export async function createInvoice(formData: FormData) {
  const { customerId, amount, status } = CreateInvoice.parse({
    customerId: formData.get('customerId'),
    amount: formData.get('amount'),
    status: formData.get('status'),
  });
}

Storing values in cents +--+
It's usually good practice to store monetary values in cents in your database to eliminate JavaScript floating-point errors and ensure greater accuracy.

Let's convert the amount into cents:
/app/lib/actions.ts
// ...
export async function createInvoice(formData: FormData) {
  const { customerId, amount, status } = CreateInvoice.parse({
    customerId: formData.get('customerId'),
    amount: formData.get('amount'),
    status: formData.get('status'),
  });
  const amountInCents = amount * 100;
}

Creating new dates +--+
Finally, let's create a new date with the format "YYYY-MM-DD" for the invoice's creation date:
/app/lib/actions.ts
// ...
export async function createInvoice(formData: FormData) {
  const { customerId, amount, status } = CreateInvoice.parse({
    customerId: formData.get('customerId'),
    amount: formData.get('amount'),
    status: formData.get('status'),
  });
  const amountInCents = amount * 100;
  const date = new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0];
}

5. Inserting the data into your database ------>
Now that you have all the values you need for your database, you can create an SQL query to insert the new invoice into your database and pass in the variables:

/app/lib/actions.ts
import { z } from 'zod';
import { sql } from '@vercel/postgres';
 
// ...
 
export async function createInvoice(formData: FormData) {
  const { customerId, amount, status } = CreateInvoice.parse({
    customerId: formData.get('customerId'),
    amount: formData.get('amount'),
    status: formData.get('status'),
  });
  const amountInCents = amount * 100;
  const date = new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0];
 
  await sql`
    INSERT INTO invoices (customer_id, amount, status, date)
    VALUES (${customerId}, ${amountInCents}, ${status}, ${date})
  `;
}

Right now, we're not handling any errors. We'll do it in the next chapter. For now, let's move on to the next step.

6. Revalidate and redirect ------>

Next.js has a Client-side Router Cache -https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/caching#router-cache  that stores the route segments in the user's browser for a time. Along with prefetching, this cache ensures that users can quickly navigate between routes while reducing the number of requests made to the server.

Since you're updating the data displayed in the invoices route, you want to clear this cache and trigger a new request to the server. You can do this with the revalidatePath function from Next.js:

/app/lib/actions.ts
'use server';
 
import { z } from 'zod';
import { sql } from '@vercel/postgres';
import { revalidatePath } from 'next/cache';
 
// ...
 
export async function createInvoice(formData: FormData) {
  const { customerId, amount, status } = CreateInvoice.parse({
    customerId: formData.get('customerId'),
    amount: formData.get('amount'),
    status: formData.get('status'),
  });
  const amountInCents = amount * 100;
  const date = new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0];
 
  await sql`
    INSERT INTO invoices (customer_id, amount, status, date)
    VALUES (${customerId}, ${amountInCents}, ${status}, ${date})
  `;
 
  revalidatePath('/dashboard/invoices');
}

Once the database has been updated, the /dashboard/invoices path will be revalidated, and fresh data will be fetched from the server.

At this point, you also want to redirect the user back to the /dashboard/invoices page. You can do this with the redirect function from Next.js:

/app/lib/actions.ts
'use server';
 
import { z } from 'zod';
import { sql } from '@vercel/postgres';
import { revalidatePath } from 'next/cache';
import { redirect } from 'next/navigation';
 
// ...
 
export async function createInvoice(formData: FormData) {
  // ...
 
  revalidatePath('/dashboard/invoices');
  redirect('/dashboard/invoices');
}

Congratulations! You've just implemented your first Server Action. Test it out by adding a new invoice, if everything is working correctly:

1. You should be redirected to the /dashboard/invoices route on submission.
2. You should see the new invoice at the top of the table.


Updating an invoice  ------>

The updating invoice form is similar to the create an invoice form, except you'll need to pass the invoice id to update the record in your database. Let's see how you can get and pass the invoice 'id'.

These are the steps you'll take to update an invoice:

1. Create a new dynamic route segment with the invoice 'id'.
2. Read the invoice id from the page params.
3. Fetch the specific invoice from your database.
4. Pre-populate the form with the invoice data.
5. Update the invoice data in your database.

1. Create a Dynamic Route Segment with the invoice id
Next.js allows you to create Dynamic Route Segments when you don't know the exact segment name and want to create routes based on data. This could be blog post titles, product pages, etc. You can create dynamic route segments by wrapping a folder's name in square brackets. For example, [id], [post] or [slug].

In your /invoices folder, create a new dynamic route called [id], then a new route called edit with a page.tsx file. Your file structure should look like this:

[] invoices
   [] [id]
      [] edit
         > page.tsx

In your <Table> component, notice there's a <UpdateInvoice /> button that receives the invoice's id from the table records.

/app/ui/invoices/table.tsx
export default async function InvoicesTable({
  query,
  currentPage,
}: {
  query: string;
  currentPage: number;
}) {
  return (
    // ...
    <td className="flex justify-end gap-2 whitespace-nowrap px-6 py-4 text-sm">
      <UpdateInvoice id={invoice.id} />
      <DeleteInvoice id={invoice.id} />
    </td>
    // ...
  );
}

Navigate to your <UpdateInvoice /> component, and update the href of the Link to accept the id prop. You can use template literals to link to a dynamic route segment:

/app/ui/invoices/buttons.tsx
import { PencilIcon, PlusIcon, TrashIcon } from '@heroicons/react/24/outline';
import Link from 'next/link';
 
// ...
 
export function UpdateInvoice({ id }: { id: string }) {
  return (
    <Link
      href={`/dashboard/invoices/${id}/edit`}
      className="rounded-md border p-2 hover:bg-gray-100"
    >
      <PencilIcon className="w-5" />
    </Link>
  );
}

2. Read the invoice id from page params
Back on your <Page> component, paste the following code:

/app/dashboard/invoices/[id]/edit/page.tsx
import Form from '@/app/ui/invoices/edit-form';
import Breadcrumbs from '@/app/ui/invoices/breadcrumbs';
import { fetchCustomers } from '@/app/lib/data';
 
export default async function Page() {
  return (
    <main>
      <Breadcrumbs
        breadcrumbs={[
          { label: 'Invoices', href: '/dashboard/invoices' },
          {
            label: 'Edit Invoice',
            href: `/dashboard/invoices/${id}/edit`,
            active: true,
          },
        ]}
      />
      <Form invoice={invoice} customers={customers} />
    </main>
  );
}

Notice how it's similar to your /create invoice page, except it imports a different form (from the edit-form.tsx file). This form should be pre-populated with a defaultValue for the customer's name, invoice amount, and status. To pre-populate the form fields, you need to fetch the specific invoice using id.

In addition to searchParams, page components also accept a prop called params which you can use to access the id. Update your <Page> component to receive the prop:

/app/dashboard/invoices/[id]/edit/page.tsx
import Form from '@/app/ui/invoices/edit-form';
import Breadcrumbs from '@/app/ui/invoices/breadcrumbs';
import { fetchCustomers } from '@/app/lib/data';
 
export default async function Page({ params }: { params: { id: string } }) {
  const id = params.id;
  // ...
}

3. Fetch the specific invoice
Then:
