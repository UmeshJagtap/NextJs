Chapter 11 
Adding Search and Pagination

In the previous chapter, you improved your dashboard's initial loading performance with streaming. Now let's move on to the /invoices page, and learn how to add search and pagination!

Starting code ------> 
Inside your /dashboard/invoices/page.tsx file, paste the following code:

/app/dashboard/invoices/page.tsx
import Pagination from '@/app/ui/invoices/pagination';
import Search from '@/app/ui/search';
import Table from '@/app/ui/invoices/table';
import { CreateInvoice } from '@/app/ui/invoices/buttons';
import { lusitana } from '@/app/ui/fonts';
import { InvoicesTableSkeleton } from '@/app/ui/skeletons';
import { Suspense } from 'react';
 
export default async function Page() {
  return (
    <div className="w-full">
      <div className="flex w-full items-center justify-between">
        <h1 className={`${lusitana.className} text-2xl`}>Invoices</h1>
      </div>
      <div className="mt-4 flex items-center justify-between gap-2 md:mt-8">
        <Search placeholder="Search invoices..." />
        <CreateInvoice />
      </div>
      {/*  <Suspense key={query + currentPage} fallback={<InvoicesTableSkeleton />}>
        <Table query={query} currentPage={currentPage} />
      </Suspense> */}
      <div className="mt-5 flex w-full justify-center">
        {/* <Pagination totalPages={totalPages} /> */}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}


Spend some time familiarizing yourself with the page and the components you'll be working with:

1. <Search/> allows users to search for specific invoices.
2. <Pagination/> allows users to navigate between pages of invoices.
3. <Table/> displays the invoices.

Your search functionality will span the client and the server. When a user searches for an invoice on the client, the URL params will be updated, data will be fetched on the server, and the table will re-render on the server with the new data.

Why use URL search params? ------>

As mentioned above, you'll be using URL search params to manage the search state. This pattern may be new if you're used to doing it with client side state.

There are a couple of benefits of implementing search with URL params:

* Bookmarkable and Shareable URLs: Since the search parameters are in the URL, users can bookmark the current state of the application, including their search queries and filters, for future reference or sharing.
* Server-Side Rendering and Initial Load: URL parameters can be directly consumed on the server to render the initial state, making it easier to handle server rendering.
* Analytics and Tracking: Having search queries and filters directly in the URL makes it easier to track user behavior without requiring additional client-side logic.

Adding the search functionality ------>

These are the Next.js client hooks that you'll use to implement the search functionality:

* useSearchParams- Allows you to access the parameters of the current URL. For example, the search params for this URL /dashboard/invoices?page=1&query=pending would look like this: {page: '1', query: 'pending'}.
* usePathname - Lets you read the current URL's pathname. For example, for the route /dashboard/invoices, usePathname would return '/dashboard/invoices'.
* useRouter - Enables navigation between routes within client components programmatically. There are multiple methods you can use.

Here's a quick overview of the implementation steps:

1. Capture the user's input.
2. Update the URL with the search params.
3. Keep the URL in sync with the input field.
4. Update the table to reflect the search query.

1. Capture the user's input  ------>

Go into the <Search> Component (/app/ui/search.tsx), and you'll notice:

* "use client" - This is a Client Component, which means you can use event listeners and hooks.
* <input> - This is the search input.

Create a new handleSearch function, and add an onChange listener to the <input> element. onChange will invoke handleSearch whenever the input value changes.

/app/ui/search.tsx

'use client';
 
import { MagnifyingGlassIcon } from '@heroicons/react/24/outline';
 
export default function Search({ placeholder }: { placeholder: string }) {
**  function handleSearch(term: string) {
**    console.log(term);
**  }
 
  return (
    <div className="relative flex flex-1 flex-shrink-0">
      <label htmlFor="search" className="sr-only">
        Search
      </label>
      <input
        className="peer block w-full rounded-md border border-gray-200 py-[9px] pl-10 text-sm outline-2 placeholder:text-gray-500"
        placeholder={placeholder}
**        onChange={(e) => {
**          handleSearch(e.target.value);
**        }}
      />
      <MagnifyingGlassIcon className="absolute left-3 top-1/2 h-[18px] w-[18px] -translate-y-1/2 text-gray-500 peer-focus:text-gray-900" />
    </div>
  );
}

Test that it's working correctly by opening the console in your Developer Tools, then type into the search field. You should see the search term logged to the console.

Great! You're capturing the user's search input. Now, you need to update the URL with the search term.

2. Update the URL with the search params  ------>

Import the useSearchParams hook from 'next/navigation', and assign it to a variable:

/app/ui/search.tsx
'use client';
 
import { MagnifyingGlassIcon } from '@heroicons/react/24/outline';
** import { useSearchParams } from 'next/navigation';
 
export default function Search() {
**  const searchParams = useSearchParams();
 
  function handleSearch(term: string) {
    console.log(term);
  }
  // ...
}

Inside handleSearch, create a new URLSearchParams -https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URLSearchParams instance using your new searchParams variable.

/app/ui/search.tsx
'use client';
 
import { MagnifyingGlassIcon } from '@heroicons/react/24/outline';
import { useSearchParams } from 'next/navigation';
 
export default function Search() {
  const searchParams = useSearchParams();
 
  function handleSearch(term: string) {
**    const params = new URLSearchParams(searchParams);
  }
  // ...
}

URLSearchParams is a Web API that provides utility methods for manipulating the URL query parameters. Instead of creating a complex string literal, you can use it to get the params string like ?page=1&query=a.

Next, set the params string based on the user’s input. If the input is empty, you want to delete it:

/app/ui/search.tsx
'use client';
 
import { MagnifyingGlassIcon } from '@heroicons/react/24/outline';
import { useSearchParams } from 'next/navigation';
 
export default function Search() {
  const searchParams = useSearchParams();
 
  function handleSearch(term: string) {
    const params = new URLSearchParams(searchParams);
    if (term) {
      params.set('query', term);
    } else {
      params.delete('query');
    }
  }
  // ...
}

Now that you have the query string. You can use Next.js's useRouter and usePathname hooks to update the URL.

Import useRouter and usePathname from 'next/navigation', and use the replace method from useRouter() inside handleSearch:

/app/ui/search.tsx
'use client';
 
import { MagnifyingGlassIcon } from '@heroicons/react/24/outline';
** import { useSearchParams, usePathname, useRouter } from 'next/navigation';
 
export default function Search() {
  const searchParams = useSearchParams();
**  const pathname = usePathname();
**  const { replace } = useRouter();
 
  function handleSearch(term: string) {
    const params = new URLSearchParams(searchParams);
    if (term) {
      params.set('query', term);
    } else {
      params.delete('query');
    }
**    replace(`${pathname}?${params.toString()}`);
  }
}

Here's a breakdown of what's happening:

* ${pathname} is the current path, in your case, "/dashboard/invoices".
* As the user types into the search bar, params.toString() translates this input into a URL-friendly format.
* replace(${pathname}?${params.toString()}) updates the URL with the user's search data. For example, /dashboard/invoices?query=lee if the user searches for "Lee".
* The URL is updated without reloading the page, thanks to Next.js's client-side navigation (which you learned about in the chapter on navigating between pages.

3. Keeping the URL and input in sync  ------>

To ensure the input field is in sync with the URL and will be populated when sharing, you can pass a defaultValue to input by reading from searchParams:

/app/ui/search.tsx
<input
  className="peer block w-full rounded-md border border-gray-200 py-[9px] pl-10 text-sm outline-2 placeholder:text-gray-500"
  placeholder={placeholder}
  onChange={(e) => {
    handleSearch(e.target.value);
  }}
  defaultValue={searchParams.get('query')?.toString()}
/>

defaultValue vs. value / Controlled vs. Uncontrolled

If you're using state to manage the value of an input, you'd use the value attribute to make it a controlled component. This means React would manage the input's state.

However, since you're not using state, you can use defaultValue. This means the native input will manage its own state. This is okay since you're saving the search query to the URL instead of state.

4. Updating the table  ------>

Finally, you need to update the table component to reflect the search query.

Navigate back to the invoices page.

Page components accept a prop called searchParams, so you can pass the current URL params to the <Table> component.

/app/dashboard/invoices/page.tsx
import Pagination from '@/app/ui/invoices/pagination';
import Search from '@/app/ui/search';
import Table from '@/app/ui/invoices/table';
import { CreateInvoice } from '@/app/ui/invoices/buttons';
import { lusitana } from '@/app/ui/fonts';
import { Suspense } from 'react';
import { InvoicesTableSkeleton } from '@/app/ui/skeletons';
 
** export default async function Page({
**   searchParams,
** }: {
**   searchParams?: {
**     query?: string;
**     page?: string;
**    };
** }) {
**   const query = searchParams?.query || '';
**   const currentPage = Number(searchParams?.page) || 1;
 
  return (
    <div className="w-full">
      <div className="flex w-full items-center justify-between">
        <h1 className={`${lusitana.className} text-2xl`}>Invoices</h1>
      </div>
      <div className="mt-4 flex items-center justify-between gap-2 md:mt-8">
        <Search placeholder="Search invoices..." />
        <CreateInvoice />
      </div>
**      <Suspense key={query + currentPage} fallback={<InvoicesTableSkeleton />}>
**        <Table query={query} currentPage={currentPage} />
**      </Suspense>
      <div className="mt-5 flex w-full justify-center">
        {/* <Pagination totalPages={totalPages} /> */}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

If you navigate to the <Table> Component, you'll see that the two props, query and currentPage, are passed to the fetchFilteredInvoices() function which returns the invoices that match the query.

/app/ui/invoices/table.tsx
// ...
export default async function InvoicesTable({
  query,
  currentPage,
}: {
  query: string;
  currentPage: number;
}) {
  const invoices = await fetchFilteredInvoices(query, currentPage);
  // ...
}

With these changes in place, go ahead and test it out. If you search for a term, you'll update the URL, which will send a new request to the server, data will be fetched on the server, and only the invoices that match your query will be returned.

When to use the useSearchParams() hook vs. the searchParams prop?

You might have noticed you used two different ways to extract search params. Whether you use one or the other depends on whether you're working on the client or the server.

** <Search> is a Client Component, so you used the useSearchParams() hook to access the params from the client.
** <Table> is a Server Component that fetches its own data, so you can pass the searchParams prop from the page to the component.

As a general rule, if you want to read the params from the client, use the useSearchParams() hook as this avoids having to go back to the server.

Best practice: Debouncing  ------>
Congratulations! You've implemented search with Next.js! But there's something you can do to optimize it.

Inside your handleSearch function, add the following console.log:
/app/ui/search.tsx
function handleSearch(term: string) {
**  console.log(`Searching... ${term}`);
 
  const params = new URLSearchParams(searchParams);
  if (term) {
    params.set('query', term);
  } else {
    params.delete('query');
  }
  replace(`${pathname}?${params.toString()}`);
}

Then type "Emil" into your search bar and check the console in dev tools. What is happening?

Dev Tools Console
Searching... E
Searching... Em
Searching... Emi
Searching... Emil

You're updating the URL on every keystroke, and therefore querying your database on every keystroke! This isn't a problem as our application is small, but imagine if your application had thousands of users, each sending a new request to your database on each keystroke.

Debouncing is a programming practice that limits the rate at which a function can fire. In our case, you only want to query the database when the user has stopped typing.

How Debouncing Works:
1. Trigger Event: When an event that should be debounced (like a keystroke in the search box) occurs, a timer starts.
2. Wait: If a new event occurs before the timer expires, the timer is reset.
3. Execution: If the timer reaches the end of its countdown, the debounced function is executed.

You can implement debouncing in a few ways, including manually creating your own debounce function. To keep things simple, we'll use a library called use-debounce.

Install use-debounce:
Terminal
pnpm i use-debounce

In your <Search> Component, import a function called useDebouncedCallback:

/app/ui/search.tsx
// ...
** import { useDebouncedCallback } from 'use-debounce';
 
// Inside the Search Component...
** const handleSearch = useDebouncedCallback((term) => {
  console.log(`Searching... ${term}`);
 
  const params = new URLSearchParams(searchParams);
  if (term) {
    params.set('query', term);
  } else {
    params.delete('query');
  }
  replace(`${pathname}?${params.toString()}`);
** }, 300);

This function will wrap the contents of handleSearch, and only run the code after a specific time once the user has stopped typing (300ms).

Now type in your search bar again, and open the console in dev tools. You should see the following:

Dev Tools Console
Searching... Emil

By debouncing, you can reduce the number of requests sent to your database, thus saving resources.

Q. What problem does debouncing solve in the search feature?
> It prevents a new database query on every keystroke
E. That's right! Debouncing prevents a new database query on every keystroke, thus saving resources.

Adding pagination  -------> 

After introducing the search feature, you'll notice the table displays only 6 invoices at a time. This is because the fetchFilteredInvoices() function in data.ts returns a maximum of 6 invoices per page.

Adding pagination allows users to navigate through the different pages to view all the invoices. Let's see how you can implement pagination using URL params, just like you did with search.

Navigate to the <Pagination/> component and you'll notice that it's a Client Component. You don't want to fetch data on the client as this would expose your database secrets (remember, you're not using an API layer). Instead, you can fetch the data on the server, and pass it to the component as a prop.

In /dashboard/invoices/page.tsx, import a new function called fetchInvoicesPages and pass the query from searchParams as an argument:

/app/dashboard/invoices/page.tsx
// ...
** import { fetchInvoicesPages } from '@/app/lib/data';
 
export default async function Page({
  searchParams,
}: {
  searchParams?: {
    query?: string,
    page?: string,
  },
}) {
  const query = searchParams?.query || '';
  const currentPage = Number(searchParams?.page) || 1;
 
**  const totalPages = await fetchInvoicesPages(query);
 
  return (
    // ...
  );
}

fetchInvoicesPages returns the total number of pages based on the search query. For example, if there are 12 invoices that match the search query, and each page displays 6 invoices, then the total number of pages would be 2.

Next, pass the totalPages prop to the <Pagination/> component:

/app/dashboard/invoices/page.tsx
// ...
 
export default async function Page({
  searchParams,
}: {
  searchParams?: {
    query?: string;
    page?: string;
  };
}) {
  const query = searchParams?.query || '';
  const currentPage = Number(searchParams?.page) || 1;
 
  const totalPages = await fetchInvoicesPages(query);
 
  return (
    <div className="w-full">
      <div className="flex w-full items-center justify-between">
        <h1 className={`${lusitana.className} text-2xl`}>Invoices</h1>
      </div>
      <div className="mt-4 flex items-center justify-between gap-2 md:mt-8">
        <Search placeholder="Search invoices..." />
        <CreateInvoice />
      </div>
      <Suspense key={query + currentPage} fallback={<InvoicesTableSkeleton />}>
        <Table query={query} currentPage={currentPage} />
      </Suspense>
      <div className="mt-5 flex w-full justify-center">
**        <Pagination totalPages={totalPages} />
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

Navigate to the <Pagination/> component and import the usePathname and useSearchParams hooks. We will use this to get the current page and set the new page. Make sure to also uncomment the code in this component. Your application will break temporarily as you haven't implemented the <Pagination/> logic yet. Let's do that now!

/app/ui/invoices/pagination.tsx
'use client';
 
import { ArrowLeftIcon, ArrowRightIcon } from '@heroicons/react/24/outline';
import clsx from 'clsx';
import Link from 'next/link';
import { generatePagination } from '@/app/lib/utils';
import { usePathname, useSearchParams } from 'next/navigation';
 
export default function Pagination({ totalPages }: { totalPages: number }) {
**  const pathname = usePathname();
**  const searchParams = useSearchParams();
**  const currentPage = Number(searchParams.get('page')) || 1;
 
  // ...
}

Next, create a new function inside the <Pagination> Component called createPageURL. Similarly to the search, you'll use URLSearchParams to set the new page number, and pathName to create the URL string.

/app/ui/invoices/pagination.tsx
'use client';
 
import { ArrowLeftIcon, ArrowRightIcon } from '@heroicons/react/24/outline';
import clsx from 'clsx';
import Link from 'next/link';
import { generatePagination } from '@/app/lib/utils';
import { usePathname, useSearchParams } from 'next/navigation';
 
export default function Pagination({ totalPages }: { totalPages: number }) {
  const pathname = usePathname();
  const searchParams = useSearchParams();
  const currentPage = Number(searchParams.get('page')) || 1;
 
**  const createPageURL = (pageNumber: number | string) => {
**    const params = new URLSearchParams(searchParams);
**    params.set('page', pageNumber.toString());
**    return `${pathname}?${params.toString()}`;
**   };
 
  // ...
}

Here's a breakdown of what's happening:
* createPageURL creates an instance of the current search parameters.
* Then, it updates the "page" parameter to the provided page number.
* Finally, it constructs the full URL using the pathname and updated search parameters.

The rest of the <Pagination> component deals with styling and different states (first, last, active, disabled, etc). We won't go into detail for this course, but feel free to look through the code to see where createPageURL is being called.

Finally, when the user types a new search query, you want to reset the page number to 1. You can do this by updating the handleSearch function in your <Search> component:

/app/ui/search.tsx
'use client';
 
import { MagnifyingGlassIcon } from '@heroicons/react/24/outline';
import { usePathname, useRouter, useSearchParams } from 'next/navigation';
import { useDebouncedCallback } from 'use-debounce';
 
export default function Search({ placeholder }: { placeholder: string }) {
  const searchParams = useSearchParams();
  const { replace } = useRouter();
  const pathname = usePathname();
 
  const handleSearch = useDebouncedCallback((term) => {
    const params = new URLSearchParams(searchParams);
    params.set('page', '1');
    if (term) {
      params.set('query', term);
    } else {
      params.delete('query');
    }
    replace(`${pathname}?${params.toString()}`);
  }, 300);
 

Summary  ------>

Congratulations! You've just implemented search and pagination using URL Params and Next.js APIs.

To summarize, in this chapter:

* You've handled search and pagination with URL search parameters instead of client state.
* You've fetched data on the server.
* You're using the useRouter router hook for smoother, client-side transitions.
These patterns are different from what you may be used to when working with client-side React, but hopefully, you now better understand the benefits of using URL search params and lifting this state to the server.

You've Completed Chapter 11
Your dashboard now has search and pagination functionality!



Chapter 12
Mutating Data


In the previous chapter, you implemented search and pagination using URL Search Params and Next.js APIs. Let's continue working on the Invoices page by adding the ability to create, update, and delete invoices!

Here are the topics we’ll cover
* What React Server Actions are and how to use them to mutate data.
[] How to work with forms and Server Components.
> Best practices for working with the native formData object, including type validation.
() How to revalidate the client cache using the revalidatePath API.
= How to create dynamic route segments with specific IDs.

What are Server Actions?  ------>

React Server Actions allow you to run asynchronous code directly on the server. They eliminate the need to create API endpoints to mutate your data. Instead, you write asynchronous functions that execute on the server and can be invoked from your Client or Server Components.

( In summary, asynchronous programming is an essential concept in JavaScript that allows your code to run in the background without blocking the execution of other code. Developers can create more efficient and responsive applications by using features like callbacks, async/await, and promises. )

Security is a top priority for web applications, as they can be vulnerable to various threats. This is where Server Actions come in. They offer an effective security solution, protecting against different types of attacks, securing your data, and ensuring authorized access. Server Actions achieve this through techniques like POST requests, encrypted closures, strict input checks, error message hashing, and host restrictions, all working together to significantly enhance your app's safety.

Using forms with Server Actions ------>

In React, you can use the action attribute in the <form> element to invoke actions. The action will automatically receive the native FormData object, containing the captured data.

For example:
// Server Component
export default function Page() {
  // Action
  async function create(formData: FormData) {
    'use server';
 
    // Logic to mutate data...
  }
 
  // Invoke the action using the "action" attribute
  return <form action={create}>...</form>;
}

An advantage of invoking a Server Action within a Server Component is progressive enhancement - forms work even if JavaScript is disabled on the client.

Next.js with Server Actions ------>

Server Actions are also deeply integrated with Next.js caching. -https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/caching When a form is submitted through a Server Action, not only can you use the action to mutate data, but you can also revalidate the associated cache using APIs like revalidatePath and revalidateTag.

Q. What's one benefit of using a Server Actions?
> Progressive Enhancement.
E. That's right! This allows users to interact with the form and submit data even if the JavaScript for the form hasn't been loaded yet or if it fails to load.

Let's see how it all works together!

Creating an invoice ------>> 

Here are the steps you'll take to create a new invoice:

1. Create a form to capture the user's input.
2. Create a Server Action and invoke it from the form.
3. Inside your Server Action, extract the data from the formData object.
4. Validate and prepare the data to be inserted into your database.
5. Insert the data and handle any errors.
6. Revalidate the cache and redirect the user back to invoices page.

1. Create a new route and form  ------> 
To start, inside the /invoices folder, add a new route segment called /create with a page.tsx file:

[] invoices   
   [] create
      > page.tsx

You'll be using this route to create new invoices. Inside your page.tsx file, paste the following code, then spend some time studying it:

/dashboard/invoices/create/page.tsx
import Form from '@/app/ui/invoices/create-form';
import Breadcrumbs from '@/app/ui/invoices/breadcrumbs';
import { fetchCustomers } from '@/app/lib/data';
 
export default async function Page() {
  const customers = await fetchCustomers();
 
  return (
    <main>
      <Breadcrumbs
        breadcrumbs={[
          { label: 'Invoices', href: '/dashboard/invoices' },
          {
            label: 'Create Invoice',
            href: '/dashboard/invoices/create',
            active: true,
          },
        ]}
      />
      <Form customers={customers} />
    </main>
  );
}

Your page is a Server Component that fetches customers and passes it to the <Form> component. To save time, we've already created the <Form> component for you.

Navigate to the <Form> component, and you'll see that the form:

* Has one <select> (dropdown) element with a list of customers.
* Has one <input> element for the amount with type="number".
* Has two <input> elements for the status with type="radio".
* Has one button with type="submit".

On http://localhost:3000/dashboard/invoices/create, you should see the following UI:

|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
||-------------------|  Invoices / Create Invoice                           |

|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|

2. Create a Server Action  ------> 
Great, now let's create a Server Action that is going to be called when the form is submitted.

Navigate to your lib directory and create a new file named actions.ts. At the top of this file, add the React use server -https://react.dev/reference/react/use-server directive:

/app/lib/actions.ts
'use server';

By adding the 'use server', you mark all the exported functions within the file as Server Actions. These server functions can then be imported and used in Client and Server components.

You can also write Server Actions directly inside Server Components by adding "use server" inside the action. But for this course, we'll keep them all organized in a separate file.

In your actions.ts file, create a new async function that accepts formData:

/app/lib/actions.ts
'use server';

export async function createInvoice(formData: FormData) {}

Then, in your <Form> component, import the createInvoice from your actions.ts file. Add a action attribute to the <form> element, and call the createInvoice action.

/app/ui/invoices/create-form.tsx
import { customerField } from '@/app/lib/definitions';
import Link from 'next/link';
import {
  CheckIcon,
  ClockIcon,
  CurrencyDollarIcon,
  UserCircleIcon,
} from '@heroicons/react/24/outline';
import { Button } from '@/app/ui/button';
** import { createInvoice } from '@/app/lib/actions';
 
export default function Form({
  customers,
}: {
  customers: customerField[];
}) {
  return (
**    <form action={createInvoice}>
      // ...
  )
}

Good to know: In HTML, you'd pass a URL to the action attribute. This URL would be the destination where your form data should be submitted (usually an API endpoint).

However, in React, the action attribute is considered a special prop - meaning React builds on top of it to allow actions to be invoked.

Behind the scenes, Server Actions create a POST API endpoint. This is why you don't need to create API endpoints manually when using Server Actions.

3. Extract the data from formData  ------>

Back in your actions.ts file, you'll need to extract the values of formData, there are a couple of methods you can use. For this example, let's use the .get(name) method.

'use server';
 
** export async function createInvoice(formData: FormData) {
**   const rawFormData = {
**     customerId: formData.get('customerId'),
**     amount: formData.get('amount'),
**     status: formData.get('status'),
**   };
**   // Test it out:
**   console.log(rawFormData);
}

Tip: If you're working with forms that have many fields, you may want to consider using the entries() method with JavaScript's Object.fromEntries(). For example:

const rawFormData = Object.fromEntries(formData.entries())

To check everything is connected correctly, go ahead and try out the form. After submitting, you should see the data you just entered into the form logged in your terminal.

Now that your data is in the shape of an object, it'll be much easier to work with.

4. Validate and prepare the data ------>

Before sending the form data to your database, you want to ensure it's in the correct format and with the correct types. If you remember from earlier in the course, your invoices table expects data in the following format:

/app/lib/definitions.ts
export type Invoice = {
  id: string; // Will be created on the database
  customer_id: string;
  amount: number; // Stored in cents
  status: 'pending' | 'paid';
  date: string;
};

So far, you only have the customer_id, amount, and status from the form.

Type validation and coercion +--+
It's important to validate that the data from your form aligns with the expected types in your database. For instance, if you add a console.log inside your action:

console.log(typeof rawFormData.amount);

You'll notice that amount is of type string and not number. This is because input elements with type="number" actually return a string, not a number!

To handle type validation, you have a few options. While you can manually validate types, using a type validation library can save you time and effort. For your example, we'll use Zod -https://zod.dev/ , a TypeScript-first validation library that can simplify this task for you.

In your actions.ts file, import Zod and define a schema that matches the shape of your form object. This schema will validate the formData before saving it to a database.

/app/lib/actions.ts
'use server';
 
import { z } from 'zod';
 
const FormSchema = z.object({
  id: z.string(),
  customerId: z.string(),
  amount: z.coerce.number(),
  status: z.enum(['pending', 'paid']),
  date: z.string(),
});
 
const CreateInvoice = FormSchema.omit({ id: true, date: true });
 
export async function createInvoice(formData: FormData) {
  // ...
}

The amount field is specifically set to coerce (change) from a string to a number while also validating its type.

You can then pass your rawFormData to CreateInvoice to validate the types:

/app/lib/actions.ts
// ...
export async function createInvoice(formData: FormData) {
  const { customerId, amount, status } = CreateInvoice.parse({
    customerId: formData.get('customerId'),
    amount: formData.get('amount'),
    status: formData.get('status'),
  });
}

Storing values in cents +--+
It's usually good practice to store monetary values in cents in your database to eliminate JavaScript floating-point errors and ensure greater accuracy.

Let's convert the amount into cents:
/app/lib/actions.ts
// ...
export async function createInvoice(formData: FormData) {
  const { customerId, amount, status } = CreateInvoice.parse({
    customerId: formData.get('customerId'),
    amount: formData.get('amount'),
    status: formData.get('status'),
  });
  const amountInCents = amount * 100;
}

Creating new dates +--+
Finally, let's create a new date with the format "YYYY-MM-DD" for the invoice's creation date:
/app/lib/actions.ts
// ...
export async function createInvoice(formData: FormData) {
  const { customerId, amount, status } = CreateInvoice.parse({
    customerId: formData.get('customerId'),
    amount: formData.get('amount'),
    status: formData.get('status'),
  });
  const amountInCents = amount * 100;
  const date = new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0];
}

5. Inserting the data into your database ------>
Now that you have all the values you need for your database, you can create an SQL query to insert the new invoice into your database and pass in the variables:

/app/lib/actions.ts
import { z } from 'zod';
import { sql } from '@vercel/postgres';
 
// ...
 
export async function createInvoice(formData: FormData) {
  const { customerId, amount, status } = CreateInvoice.parse({
    customerId: formData.get('customerId'),
    amount: formData.get('amount'),
    status: formData.get('status'),
  });
  const amountInCents = amount * 100;
  const date = new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0];
 
  await sql`
    INSERT INTO invoices (customer_id, amount, status, date)
    VALUES (${customerId}, ${amountInCents}, ${status}, ${date})
  `;
}

Right now, we're not handling any errors. We'll do it in the next chapter. For now, let's move on to the next step.

6. Revalidate and redirect ------>

Next.js has a Client-side Router Cache -https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/caching#router-cache  that stores the route segments in the user's browser for a time. Along with prefetching, this cache ensures that users can quickly navigate between routes while reducing the number of requests made to the server.

Since you're updating the data displayed in the invoices route, you want to clear this cache and trigger a new request to the server. You can do this with the revalidatePath function from Next.js:

/app/lib/actions.ts
'use server';
 
import { z } from 'zod';
import { sql } from '@vercel/postgres';
import { revalidatePath } from 'next/cache';
 
// ...
 
export async function createInvoice(formData: FormData) {
  const { customerId, amount, status } = CreateInvoice.parse({
    customerId: formData.get('customerId'),
    amount: formData.get('amount'),
    status: formData.get('status'),
  });
  const amountInCents = amount * 100;
  const date = new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0];
 
  await sql`
    INSERT INTO invoices (customer_id, amount, status, date)
    VALUES (${customerId}, ${amountInCents}, ${status}, ${date})
  `;
 
  revalidatePath('/dashboard/invoices');
}

Once the database has been updated, the /dashboard/invoices path will be revalidated, and fresh data will be fetched from the server.

At this point, you also want to redirect the user back to the /dashboard/invoices page. You can do this with the redirect function from Next.js:

/app/lib/actions.ts
'use server';
 
import { z } from 'zod';
import { sql } from '@vercel/postgres';
import { revalidatePath } from 'next/cache';
import { redirect } from 'next/navigation';
 
// ...
 
export async function createInvoice(formData: FormData) {
  // ...
 
  revalidatePath('/dashboard/invoices');
  redirect('/dashboard/invoices');
}

Congratulations! You've just implemented your first Server Action. Test it out by adding a new invoice, if everything is working correctly:

1. You should be redirected to the /dashboard/invoices route on submission.
2. You should see the new invoice at the top of the table.


Updating an invoice  ------>

The updating invoice form is similar to the create an invoice form, except you'll need to pass the invoice id to update the record in your database. Let's see how you can get and pass the invoice 'id'.

These are the steps you'll take to update an invoice:

1. Create a new dynamic route segment with the invoice 'id'.
2. Read the invoice id from the page params.
3. Fetch the specific invoice from your database.
4. Pre-populate the form with the invoice data.
5. Update the invoice data in your database.

1. Create a Dynamic Route Segment with the invoice id ---
Next.js allows you to create Dynamic Route Segments when you don't know the exact segment name and want to create routes based on data. This could be blog post titles, product pages, etc. You can create dynamic route segments by wrapping a folder's name in square brackets. For example, [id], [post] or [slug].

In your /invoices folder, create a new dynamic route called [id], then a new route called edit with a page.tsx file. Your file structure should look like this:

[] invoices
   [] [id]
      [] edit
         > page.tsx

In your <Table> component, notice there's a <UpdateInvoice /> button that receives the invoice's id from the table records.

/app/ui/invoices/table.tsx
export default async function InvoicesTable({
  query,
  currentPage,
}: {
  query: string;
  currentPage: number;
}) {
  return (
    // ...
    <td className="flex justify-end gap-2 whitespace-nowrap px-6 py-4 text-sm">
      <UpdateInvoice id={invoice.id} />
      <DeleteInvoice id={invoice.id} />
    </td>
    // ...
  );
}

Navigate to your <UpdateInvoice /> component, and update the href of the Link to accept the id prop. You can use template literals to link to a dynamic route segment:

/app/ui/invoices/buttons.tsx
import { PencilIcon, PlusIcon, TrashIcon } from '@heroicons/react/24/outline';
import Link from 'next/link';
 
// ...
 
export function UpdateInvoice({ id }: { id: string }) {
  return (
    <Link
      href={`/dashboard/invoices/${id}/edit`}
      className="rounded-md border p-2 hover:bg-gray-100"
    >
      <PencilIcon className="w-5" />
    </Link>
  );
}

2. Read the invoice id from page params ---
Back on your <Page> component, paste the following code:

/app/dashboard/invoices/[id]/edit/page.tsx
import Form from '@/app/ui/invoices/edit-form';
import Breadcrumbs from '@/app/ui/invoices/breadcrumbs';
import { fetchCustomers } from '@/app/lib/data';
 
export default async function Page() {
  return (
    <main>
      <Breadcrumbs
        breadcrumbs={[
          { label: 'Invoices', href: '/dashboard/invoices' },
          {
            label: 'Edit Invoice',
            href: `/dashboard/invoices/${id}/edit`,
            active: true,
          },
        ]}
      />
      <Form invoice={invoice} customers={customers} />
    </main>
  );
}

Notice how it's similar to your /create invoice page, except it imports a different form (from the edit-form.tsx file). This form should be pre-populated with a defaultValue for the customer's name, invoice amount, and status. To pre-populate the form fields, you need to fetch the specific invoice using id.

In addition to searchParams, page components also accept a prop called params which you can use to access the id. Update your <Page> component to receive the prop:

/app/dashboard/invoices/[id]/edit/page.tsx
import Form from '@/app/ui/invoices/edit-form';
import Breadcrumbs from '@/app/ui/invoices/breadcrumbs';
import { fetchCustomers } from '@/app/lib/data';
 
export default async function Page({ params }: { params: { id: string } }) {
  const id = params.id;
  // ...
}

3. Fetch the specific invoice ---
Then:
* Import a new function called fetchInvoiceById and pass the id as an argument.
* Import fetchCustomers to fetch the customer names for the dropdown.
You can use Promise.all to fetch both the invoice and customers in parallel:

/dashboard/invoices/[id]/edit/page.tsx
import Form from '@/app/ui/invoices/edit-form';
import Breadcrumbs from '@/app/ui/invoices/breadcrumbs';
import { fetchInvoiceById, fetchCustomers } from '@/app/lib/data';
 
export default async function Page({ params }: { params: { id: string } }) {
  const id = params.id;
  const [invoice, customers] = await Promise.all([
    fetchInvoiceById(id),
    fetchCustomers(),
  ]);
  // ...
}

You will see a temporary TS error for the invoice prop in your terminal because invoice could be potentially undefined. Don't worry about it for now, you'll resolve it in the next chapter when you add error handling.

Great! Now, test that everything is wired correctly. Visit http://localhost:3000/dashboard/invoices and click on the Pencil icon to edit an invoice. After navigation, you should see a form that is pre-populated with the invoice details:

|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
||-------------------|  Invoices / Edit Invoice                             |
||                   |                                                      |

|| ^ Customers       |                                                      |
||-------------------|                          Cancel    Edit Invoice      |
||                   |                                                      |
||___________________|                                                      |
|| (*) Sign Out      |                                                      |
||-------------------|                                                      |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|

The URL should also be updated with an id as follows: http://localhost:3000/dashboard/invoice/uuid/edit


UUIDs vs. Auto-incrementing Keys

We use UUIDs instead of incrementing keys (e.g., 1, 2, 3, etc.). This makes the URL longer; however, UUIDs eliminate the risk of ID collision, are globally unique, and reduce the risk of enumeration attacks - making them ideal for large databases.

However, if you prefer cleaner URLs, you might prefer to use auto-incrementing keys.

4. Pass the id to the Server Action ---
Lastly, you want to pass the id to the Server Action so you can update the right record in your database. You cannot pass the id as an argument like so:

/app/ui/invoices/edit-form.tsx
// Passing an id as argument won't work
<form action={updateInvoice(id)}>

Instead, you can pass id to the Server Action using JS bind. This will ensure that any values passed to the Server Action are encoded.

/app/ui/invoices/edit-form.tsx
// ...
import { updateInvoice } from '@/app/lib/actions';
 
export default function EditInvoiceForm({
  invoice,
  customers,
}: {
  invoice: InvoiceForm;
  customers: CustomerField[];
}) {
  const updateInvoiceWithId = updateInvoice.bind(null, invoice.id);
 
  return (
    <form action={updateInvoiceWithId}>
      <input type="hidden" name="id" value={invoice.id} />
    </form>
  );
}

Note: Using a hidden input field in your form also works (e.g. <input type="hidden" name="id" value={invoice.id} />). However, the values will appear as full text in the HTML source, which is not ideal for sensitive data like IDs.

Then, in your actions.ts file, create a new action, updateInvoice:

/app/lib/actions.ts
// Use Zod to update the expected types
const UpdateInvoice = FormSchema.omit({ id: true, date: true });
 
// ...
 
export async function updateInvoice(id: string, formData: FormData) {
  const { customerId, amount, status } = UpdateInvoice.parse({
    customerId: formData.get('customerId'),
    amount: formData.get('amount'),
    status: formData.get('status'),
  });
 
  const amountInCents = amount * 100;
 
  await sql`
    UPDATE invoices
    SET customer_id = ${customerId}, amount = ${amountInCents}, status = ${status}
    WHERE id = ${id}
  `;
 
  revalidatePath('/dashboard/invoices');
  redirect('/dashboard/invoices');
}

Similarly to the createInvoice action, here you are:

1. Extracting the data from formData.
2. Validating the types with Zod.
3. Converting the amount to cents.
4. Passing the variables to your SQL query.
5. Calling revalidatePath to clear the client cache and make a new server request.
6. Calling redirect to redirect the user to the invoice's page.

Test it out by editing an invoice. After submitting the form, you should be redirected to the invoices page, and the invoice should be updated.

Deleting an invoice
To delete an invoice using a Server Action, wrap the delete button in a <form> element and pass the id to the Server Action using bind:

/app/ui/invoices/buttons.tsx
import { deleteInvoice } from '@/app/lib/actions';
 
// ...
 
export function DeleteInvoice({ id }: { id: string }) {
  const deleteInvoiceWithId = deleteInvoice.bind(null, id);
 
  return (
    <form action={deleteInvoiceWithId}>
      <button type="submit" className="rounded-md border p-2 hover:bg-gray-100">
        <span className="sr-only">Delete</span>
        <TrashIcon className="w-4" />
      </button>
    </form>
  );
}

Inside your actions.ts file, create a new action called deleteInvoice.

/app/lib/actions.ts
export async function deleteInvoice(id: string) {
  await sql`DELETE FROM invoices WHERE id = ${id}`;
  revalidatePath('/dashboard/invoices');
}

Since this action is being called in the /dashboard/invoices path, you don't need to call redirect. Calling revalidatePath will trigger a new server request and re-render the table.

Chapter 13
Handling Errors

In the previous chapter, you learned how to mutate data using Server Actions. Let's see how you can handle errors gracefully using JavaScript's try/catch statements and Next.js APIs.

Adding try/catch to Server Actions ------>

First, let's add JavaScript's try/catch statements to your Server Actions to allow you to handle errors gracefully.

If you know how to do this, spend a few minutes updating your Server Actions, or you can copy the code below:          

/app/lib/actions.ts
export async function createInvoice(formData: FormData) {
  const { customerId, amount, status } = CreateInvoice.parse({
    customerId: formData.get('customerId'),
    amount: formData.get('amount'),
    status: formData.get('status'),
  });
 
  const amountInCents = amount * 100;
  const date = new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0];
 
  try {
    await sql`
      INSERT INTO invoices (customer_id, amount, status, date)
      VALUES (${customerId}, ${amountInCents}, ${status}, ${date})
    `;
  } catch (error) {
    return {
      message: 'Database Error: Failed to Create Invoice.',
    };
  }
 
  revalidatePath('/dashboard/invoices');
  redirect('/dashboard/invoices');
}

/app/lib/actions.ts
export async function updateInvoice(id: string, formData: FormData) {
  const { customerId, amount, status } = UpdateInvoice.parse({
    customerId: formData.get('customerId'),
    amount: formData.get('amount'),
    status: formData.get('status'),
  });
 
  const amountInCents = amount * 100;
 
  try {
    await sql`
        UPDATE invoices
        SET customer_id = ${customerId}, amount = ${amountInCents}, status = ${status}
        WHERE id = ${id}
      `;
  } catch (error) {
    return { message: 'Database Error: Failed to Update Invoice.' };
  }
 
  revalidatePath('/dashboard/invoices');
  redirect('/dashboard/invoices');
}

/app/lib/actions.ts
export async function deleteInvoice(id: string) {
  try {
    await sql`DELETE FROM invoices WHERE id = ${id}`;
    revalidatePath('/dashboard/invoices');
    return { message: 'Deleted Invoice.' };
  } catch (error) {
    return { message: 'Database Error: Failed to Delete Invoice.' };
  }
}

Note how redirect is being called outside of the try/catch block. This is because redirect works by throwing an error, which would be caught by the catch block. To avoid this, you can call redirect after try/catch. redirect would only be reachable if try is successful.

Now, let's check what happens when an error is thrown in your Server Action. You can do this by throwing an error earlier. For example, in the deleteInvoice action, throw an error at the top of the function:

/app/lib/actions.ts
export async function deleteInvoice(id: string) {
  throw new Error('Failed to Delete Invoice');
 
  // Unreachable code block
  try {
    await sql`DELETE FROM invoices WHERE id = ${id}`;
    revalidatePath('/dashboard/invoices');
    return { message: 'Deleted Invoice' };
  } catch (error) {
    return { message: 'Database Error: Failed to Delete Invoice' };
  }
}

When you try to delete an invoice, you should see an error on localhost. Ensure that you remove this error after testing and before moving onto the next section.

Seeing these errors are helpful while developing as you can catch any potential problems early. However, you also want to show errors to the user to avoid an abrupt failure and allow your application to continue running.

This is where Next.js error.tsx file comes in. -https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/error 

Handling all errors with error.tsx ------>

The error.tsx file can be used to define a UI boundary for a route segment. It serves as a catch-all for unexpected errors and allows you to display a fallback UI to your users.

Inside your /dashboard/invoices folder, create a new file called error.tsx and paste the following code:

/dashboard/invoices/error.tsx
'use client';
 
import { useEffect } from 'react';
 
export default function Error({
  error,
  reset,
}: {
  error: Error & { digest?: string };
  reset: () => void;
}) {
  useEffect(() => {
    // Optionally log the error to an error reporting service
    console.error(error);
  }, [error]);
 
  return (
    <main className="flex h-full flex-col items-center justify-center">
      <h2 className="text-center">Something went wrong!</h2>
      <button
        className="mt-4 rounded-md bg-blue-500 px-4 py-2 text-sm text-white transition-colors hover:bg-blue-400"
        onClick={
          // Attempt to recover by trying to re-render the invoices route
          () => reset()
        }
      >
        Try again
      </button>
    </main>
  );
}

There are a few things you'll notice about the code above:

* "use client" - error.tsx needs to be a Client Component.
* It accepts two props:
  > error: This object is an instance of JavaScript's native Error object.
  > reset: This is a function to reset the error boundary. When executed, the function will try to re-render the route segment.
When you try to delete an invoice again, you should see the following UI:

|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|


Handling 404 errors with the notFound function ------>

Another way you can handle errors gracefully is by using the notFound function. While error.tsx is useful for catching all errors, notFound can be used when you try to fetch a resource that doesn't exist.

For example, visit http://localhost:3000/dashboard/invoices/2e94d1ed-d220-449f-9f11-f0bbceed9645/edit.

This is a fake UUID that doesn't exist in your database.

You'll immediately see error.tsx kicks in because this is a child route of /invoices where error.tsx is defined.

However, if you want to be more specific, you can show a 404 error to tell the user the resource they're trying to access hasn't been found.

You can confirm that the resource hasn't been found by going into your fetchInvoiceById function in data.ts, and console logging the returned invoice:

/app/lib/data.ts
export async function fetchInvoiceById(id: string) {
  noStore();
  try {
    // ...
 
    console.log(invoice); // Invoice is an empty array []
    return invoice[0];
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Database Error:', error);
    throw new Error('Failed to fetch invoice.');
  }
}

Now that you know the invoice doesn't exist in your database, let's use notFound to handle it. Navigate to /dashboard/invoices/[id]/edit/page.tsx, and import { notFound } from 'next/navigation'.

Then, you can use a conditional to invoke notFound if the invoice doesn't exist:

/dashboard/invoices/[id]/edit/page.tsx
import { fetchInvoiceById, fetchCustomers } from '@/app/lib/data';
import { updateInvoice } from '@/app/lib/actions';
import { notFound } from 'next/navigation';
 
export default async function Page({ params }: { params: { id: string } }) {
  const id = params.id;
  const [invoice, customers] = await Promise.all([
    fetchInvoiceById(id),
    fetchCustomers(),
  ]);
 
  if (!invoice) {
    notFound();
  }
 
  // ...
}

Perfect! <Page> will now throw an error if a specific invoice is not found. To show an error UI to the user. Create a not-found.tsx file inside the /edit folder.

[] invoices
   [] [id]
      [] edit
         > page.tsx
         * not-found

Then, inside the not-found.tsx file, paste the following the code:

/dashboard/invoices/[id]/edit/not-found.tsx
import Link from 'next/link';
import { FaceFrownIcon } from '@heroicons/react/24/outline';
 
export default function NotFound() {
  return (
    <main className="flex h-full flex-col items-center justify-center gap-2">
      <FaceFrownIcon className="w-10 text-gray-400" />
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">404 Not Found</h2>
      <p>Could not find the requested invoice.</p>
      <Link
        href="/dashboard/invoices"
        className="mt-4 rounded-md bg-blue-500 px-4 py-2 text-sm text-white transition-colors hover:bg-blue-400"
      >
        Go Back
      </Link>
    </main>
  );
}

Refresh the route, and you should now see the following UI:

|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
||-------------------|                                                      |
||                   |                                                      |
||                   |                                                      |

|| ^ Customers       |                    [ Go Back ]                       |

||                   |                                                      |
||                   |                                                      |

|| (*) Sign Out      |                                                      |
||___________________|                                                      |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|

That's something to keep in mind, notFound will take precedence over error.tsx, so you can reach out for it when you want to handle more specific errors!

Q. Which file in Next.js serves as a catch-all for unexpected errors in your route segments?
> error.tsx
E. The `error.tsx` file serves as a catch-all for unexpected errors and allows you to display a fallback UI to your users.

Chapter 14
Improving Accessibility

In the previous chapter, we looked at how to catch errors (including 404 errors) and display a fallback to the user. However, we still need to discuss another piece of the puzzle: form validation. Let's see how to implement server-side validation with Server Actions, and how you can show form errors using React's useActionState hook - while keeping accessibility in mind!

What is accessibility?  ------>

Accessibility refers to designing and implementing web applications that everyone can use, including those with disabilities. It's a vast topic that covers many areas, such as keyboard navigation, semantic HTML, images, colors, videos, etc.

While we won't go in-depth into accessibility in this course, we'll discuss the accessibility features available in Next.js and some common practices to make your applications more accessible.

If you'd like to learn more about accessibility, we recommend the Learn Accessibility course by web.dev.

Using the ESLint accessibility plugin in Next.js ------>
Next.js includes the eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y plugin in its ESLint config to help catch accessibility issues early. For example, this plugin warns if you have images without alt text, use the aria-* and role attributes incorrectly, and more.

Optionally, if you would like to try this out, add next lint as a script in your package.json file:

/package.json
"scripts": {
    "build": "next build",
    "dev": "next dev",
    "start": "next start",
    "lint": "next lint"
},

Then run pnpm lint in your terminal:
Terminal
pnpm lint

This will guide you through installing and configuring ESLint for your project. If you were to run pnpm lint now, you should see the following output:
Terminal
✔ No ESLint warnings or errors

However, what would happen if you had an image without alt text? Let's find out!

Go to /app/ui/invoices/table.tsx and remove the alt prop from the image. You can use your editor's search feature to quickly find the <Image>:

/app/ui/invoices/table.tsx
<Image
  src={invoice.image_url}
  className="rounded-full"
  width={28}
  height={28}
  alt={`${invoice.name}'s profile picture`} // Delete this line
/>

Now run pnpm lint again, and you should see the following warning:
Terminal
./app/ui/invoices/table.tsx
45:25  Warning: Image elements must have an alt prop,
either with meaningful text, or an empty string for decorative images. jsx-a11y/alt-text

While adding and configuring a linter is not a required step, it can be helpful to catch accessibility issues in your development process.

Improving form accessibility  ------>

There are three things we're already doing to improve accessibility in our forms:

* Semantic HTML: Using semantic elements (<input>, <option>, etc) instead of <div>. This allows assistive technologies (AT) to focus on the input elements and provide appropriate contextual information to the user, making the form easier to navigate and understand.
* Labelling: Including <label> and the htmlFor attribute ensures that each form field has a descriptive text label. This improves AT support by providing context and also enhances usability by allowing users to click on the label to focus on the corresponding input field.
* Focus Outline: The fields are properly styled to show an outline when they are in focus. This is critical for accessibility as it visually indicates the active element on the page, helping both keyboard and screen reader users to understand where they are on the form. You can verify this by pressing tab.

These practices lay a good foundation for making your forms more accessible to many users. However, they don't address form validation and errors.

Form validation  ------>
Go to http://localhost:3000/dashboard/invoices/create, and submit an empty form. What happens?

You get an error! This is because you're sending empty form values to your Server Action. You can prevent this by validating your form on the client or the server.

Client-Side validation ------>
There are a couple of ways you can validate forms on the client. The simplest would be to rely on the form validation provided by the browser by adding the required attribute to the <input> and <select> elements in your forms. For example:

/app/ui/invoices/create-form.tsx
<input
  id="amount"
  name="amount"
  type="number"
  placeholder="Enter USD amount"
  className="peer block w-full rounded-md border border-gray-200 py-2 pl-10 text-sm outline-2 placeholder:text-gray-500"
  required
/>

Submit the form again. The browser will display a warning if you try to submit a form with empty values.

This approach is generally okay because some ATs support browser validation.

An alternative to client-side validation is server-side validation. Let's see how you can implement it in the next section. For now, delete the required attributes if you added them.

Server-Side validation ------>
By validating forms on the server, you can:
* Ensure your data is in the expected format before sending it to your database.
* Reduce the risk of malicious users bypassing client-side validation.
* Have one source of truth for what is considered valid data.

In your create-form.tsx component, import the useActionState hook from react. Since useActionState is a hook, you will need to turn your form into a Client Component using "use client" directive:

/app/ui/invoices/create-form.tsx
'use client';
 
// ...
import { useActionState } from 'react';

Inside your Form Component, the useActionState hook:
* Takes two arguments: (action, initialState).
* Returns two values: [state, formAction] - the form state, and a function to be called when the form is submitted.

Pass your createInvoice action as an argument of useActionState, and inside your <form action={}> attribute, call formAction.

/app/ui/invoices/create-form.tsx
// ...
import { useActionState } from 'react';
 
export default function Form({ customers }: { customers: CustomerField[] }) {
  const [state, formAction] = useActionState(createInvoice, initialState);
 
  return <form action={formAction}>...</form>;
}

The initialState can be anything you define, in this case, create an object with two empty keys: message and errors, and import the State type from your actions.ts file:

/app/ui/invoices/create-form.tsx
// ...
import { createInvoice, State } from '@/app/lib/actions';
import { useActionState } from 'react';
 
export default function Form({ customers }: { customers: CustomerField[] }) {
  const initialState: State = { message: null, errors: {} };
  const [state, formAction] = useActionState(createInvoice, initialState);
 
  return <form action={formAction}>...</form>;
}

This may seem confusing initially, but it'll make more sense once you update the server action. Let's do that now.

In your action.ts file, you can use Zod to validate form data. Update your FormSchema as follows:

/app/lib/actions.ts
const FormSchema = z.object({
  id: z.string(),
  customerId: z.string({
    invalid_type_error: 'Please select a customer.',
  }),
  amount: z.coerce
    .number()
    .gt(0, { message: 'Please enter an amount greater than $0.' }),
  status: z.enum(['pending', 'paid'], {
    invalid_type_error: 'Please select an invoice status.',
  }),
  date: z.string(),
});

* customerId - Zod already throws an error if the customer field is empty as it expects a type string. But let's add a friendly message if the user doesn't select a customer.
* amount - Since you are coercing the amount type from string to number, it'll default to zero if the string is empty. Let's tell Zod we always want the amount greater than 0 with the .gt() function.
* status - Zod already throws an error if the status field is empty as it expects "pending" or "paid". Let's also add a friendly message if the user doesn't select a status.

Next, update your createInvoice action to accept two parameters - prevState and formData:

/app/lib/actions.ts
export type State = {
  errors?: {
    customerId?: string[];
    amount?: string[];
    status?: string[];
  };
  message?: string | null;
};
 
export async function createInvoice(prevState: State, formData: FormData) {
  // ...
}

* formData - same as before.
* prevState - contains the state passed from the useActionState hook. You won't be using it in the action in this example, but it's a required prop.
Then, change the Zod parse() function to safeParse():

/app/lib/actions.ts
export async function createInvoice(prevState: State, formData: FormData) {
  // Validate form fields using Zod
  const validatedFields = CreateInvoice.safeParse({
    customerId: formData.get('customerId'),
    amount: formData.get('amount'),
    status: formData.get('status'),
  });
 
  // ...
}

safeParse() will return an object containing either a success or error field. This will help handle validation more gracefully without having put this logic inside the try/catch block.

Before sending the information to your database, check if the form fields were validated correctly with a conditional:

/app/lib/actions.ts
export async function createInvoice(prevState: State, formData: FormData) {
  // Validate form fields using Zod
  const validatedFields = CreateInvoice.safeParse({
    customerId: formData.get('customerId'),
    amount: formData.get('amount'),
    status: formData.get('status'),
  });
 
  // If form validation fails, return errors early. Otherwise, continue.
  if (!validatedFields.success) {
    return {
      errors: validatedFields.error.flatten().fieldErrors,
      message: 'Missing Fields. Failed to Create Invoice.',
    };
  }
 
  // ...
}

If validatedFields isn't successful, we return the function early with the error messages from Zod.

Tip: console.log validatedFields and submit an empty form to see the shape of it.

Finally, since you're handling form validation separately, outside your try/catch block, you can return a specific message for any database errors, your final code should look like this:

/app/lib/actions.ts
export async function createInvoice(prevState: State, formData: FormData) {
  // Validate form using Zod
  const validatedFields = CreateInvoice.safeParse({
    customerId: formData.get('customerId'),
    amount: formData.get('amount'),
    status: formData.get('status'),
  });
 
  // If form validation fails, return errors early. Otherwise, continue.
  if (!validatedFields.success) {
    return {
      errors: validatedFields.error.flatten().fieldErrors,
      message: 'Missing Fields. Failed to Create Invoice.',
    };
  }
 
  // Prepare data for insertion into the database
  const { customerId, amount, status } = validatedFields.data;
  const amountInCents = amount * 100;
  const date = new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0];
 
  // Insert data into the database
  try {
    await sql`
      INSERT INTO invoices (customer_id, amount, status, date)
      VALUES (${customerId}, ${amountInCents}, ${status}, ${date})
    `;
  } catch (error) {
    // If a database error occurs, return a more specific error.
    return {
      message: 'Database Error: Failed to Create Invoice.',
    };
  }
 
  // Revalidate the cache for the invoices page and redirect the user.
  revalidatePath('/dashboard/invoices');
  redirect('/dashboard/invoices');
}

Great, now let's display the errors in your form component. Back in the create-form.tsx component, you can access the errors using the form state.

Add a ternary operator that checks for each specific error. For example, after the customer's field, you can add:

/app/ui/invoices/create-form.tsx
<form action={formAction}>
  <div className="rounded-md bg-gray-50 p-4 md:p-6">
    {/* Customer Name */}
    <div className="mb-4">
      <label htmlFor="customer" className="mb-2 block text-sm font-medium">
        Choose customer
      </label>
      <div className="relative">
        <select
          id="customer"
          name="customerId"
          className="peer block w-full rounded-md border border-gray-200 py-2 pl-10 text-sm outline-2 placeholder:text-gray-500"
          defaultValue=""
          aria-describedby="customer-error"
        >
          <option value="" disabled>
            Select a customer
          </option>
          {customers.map((name) => (
            <option key={name.id} value={name.id}>
              {name.name}
            </option>
          ))}
        </select>
        <UserCircleIcon className="pointer-events-none absolute left-3 top-1/2 h-[18px] w-[18px] -translate-y-1/2 text-gray-500" />
      </div>
      <div id="customer-error" aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="true">
        {state.errors?.customerId &&
          state.errors.customerId.map((error: string) => (
            <p className="mt-2 text-sm text-red-500" key={error}>
              {error}
            </p>
          ))}
      </div>
    </div>
    // ...
  </div>
</form>

Tip: You can console.log state inside your component and check if everything is wired correctly. Check the console in Dev Tools as your form is now a Client Component.

In the code above, you're also adding the following aria labels:

* aria-describedby="customer-error": This establishes a relationship between the select element and the error message container. It indicates that the container with id="customer-error" describes the select element. Screen readers will read this description when the user interacts with the select box to notify them of errors.
* id="customer-error": This id attribute uniquely identifies the HTML element that holds the error message for the select input. This is necessary for aria-describedby to establish the relationship.
* aria-live="polite": The screen reader should politely notify the user when the error inside the div is updated. When the content changes (e.g. when a user corrects an error), the screen reader will announce these changes, but only when the user is idle so as not to interrupt them.

Practice: Adding aria labels  ------>
Using the example above, add errors to your remaining form fields. You should also show a message at the bottom of the form if any fields are missing. Your UI should look like this:

Once you're ready, run pnpm lint to check if you're using the aria labels correctly.

If you'd like to challenge yourself, take the knowledge you've learned in this chapter and add form validation to the edit-form.tsx component.

You'll need to:

* Add useActionState to your edit-form.tsx component.
* Edit the updateInvoice action to handle validation errors from Zod.
* Display the errors in your component, and add aria labels to improve accessibility.
Once you're ready, expand the code snippet below to see the solution:

Edit Invoice Form:
/app/ui/invoices/edit-form.tsx
// ...
import { updateInvoice, State } from '@/app/lib/actions';
import { useActionState } from 'react';
 
export default function EditInvoiceForm({
  invoice,
  customers,
}: {
  invoice: InvoiceForm;
  customers: CustomerField[];
}) {
  const initialState: State = { message: null, errors: {} };
  const updateInvoiceWithId = updateInvoice.bind(null, invoice.id);
  const [state, formAction] = useActionState(updateInvoiceWithId, initialState);
 
  return <form action={formAction}></form>;
}

Server Action:

/app/lib/actions.ts
export async function updateInvoice(
  id: string,
  prevState: State,
  formData: FormData,
) {
  const validatedFields = UpdateInvoice.safeParse({
    customerId: formData.get('customerId'),
    amount: formData.get('amount'),
    status: formData.get('status'),
  });
 
  if (!validatedFields.success) {
    return {
      errors: validatedFields.error.flatten().fieldErrors,
      message: 'Missing Fields. Failed to Update Invoice.',
    };
  }
 
  const { customerId, amount, status } = validatedFields.data;
  const amountInCents = amount * 100;
 
  try {
    await sql`
      UPDATE invoices
      SET customer_id = ${customerId}, amount = ${amountInCents}, status = ${status}
      WHERE id = ${id}
    `;
  } catch (error) {
    return { message: 'Database Error: Failed to Update Invoice.' };
  }
 
  revalidatePath('/dashboard/invoices');
  redirect('/dashboard/invoices');
}

You've Completed Chapter 14
Great, you've learned how to improve accessibility in your forms with React Form Status and Server-side Validation.



Chapter 15
Adding Authentication

In the previous chapter, you finished building the invoices routes by adding form validation and improving accessibility. In this chapter, you'll be adding authentication to your dashboard.


What is authentication?  ------>

Authentication is a key part of many web applications today. It's how a system checks if the user is who they say they are.

A secure website often uses multiple ways to check a user's identity. For instance, after entering your username and password, the site may send a verification code to your device or use an external app like Google Authenticator. This 2-factor authentication (2FA) helps increase security. Even if someone learns your password, they can't access your account without your unique token.

Authentication vs. Authorization --
In web development, authentication and authorization serve different roles:

* Authentication is about making sure the user is who they say they are. You're proving your identity with something you have like a username and password.
* Authorization is the next step. Once a user's identity is confirmed, authorization decides what parts of the application they are allowed to use.
So, authentication checks who you are, and authorization determines what you can do or access in the application.

Q. Which of the following best describes the difference between authentication and authorization?
> Authentication verifies your identity. Authorization determines what you can access.
E.That's right! Although they sound similar, authentication verifies your identity while authorization determines what you can access.

Creating the login route ------>
Start by creating a new route in your application called /login and paste the following code:

/app/login/page.tsx
import AcmeLogo from '@/app/ui/acme-logo';
import LoginForm from '@/app/ui/login-form';
 
export default function LoginPage() {
  return (
    <main className="flex items-center justify-center md:h-screen">
      <div className="relative mx-auto flex w-full max-w-[400px] flex-col space-y-2.5 p-4 md:-mt-32">
        <div className="flex h-20 w-full items-end rounded-lg bg-blue-500 p-3 md:h-36">
          <div className="w-32 text-white md:w-36">
            <AcmeLogo />
          </div>
        </div>
        <LoginForm />
      </div>
    </main>
  );
}

You'll notice the page imports <LoginForm />, which you'll update later in the chapter.


NextAuth.js  ------>

We will be using NextAuth.js -https://nextjs.authjs.dev/ to add authentication to your application. NextAuth.js abstracts away much of the complexity involved in managing sessions, sign-in and sign-out, and other aspects of authentication. While you can manually implement these features, the process can be time-consuming and error-prone. NextAuth.js simplifies the process, providing a unified solution for auth in Next.js applications.


Setting up NextAuth.js ------>
Install NextAuth.js by running the following command in your terminal:

Terminal
pnpm i next-auth@beta

Here, you're installing the beta version of NextAuth.js, which is compatible with Next.js 14.

Next, generate a secret key for your application. This key is used to encrypt cookies, ensuring the security of user sessions. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

Terminal
openssl rand -base64 32

Then, in your .env file, add your generated key to the AUTH_SECRET variable:
.env
AUTH_SECRET=your-secret-key

For auth to work in production, you'll need to update your environment variables in your Vercel project too. Check out this guide -https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables on how to add environment variables on Vercel.


Adding the pages option ------>
Create an auth.config.ts file at the root of our project that exports an authConfig object. This object will contain the configuration options for NextAuth.js. For now, it will only contain the pages option:

/auth.config.ts
import type { NextAuthConfig } from 'next-auth';
 
export const authConfig = {
  pages: {
    signIn: '/login',
  },
} satisfies NextAuthConfig;

You can use the pages option to specify the route for custom sign-in, sign-out, and error pages. This is not required, but by adding signIn: '/login' into our pages option, the user will be redirected to our custom login page, rather than the NextAuth.js default page.


Protecting your routes with Next.js Middleware ------>
Next, add the logic to protect your routes. This will prevent users from accessing the dashboard pages unless they are logged in.

/auth.config.ts
import type { NextAuthConfig } from 'next-auth';
 
export const authConfig = {
  pages: {
    signIn: '/login',
  },
  callbacks: {
    authorized({ auth, request: { nextUrl } }) {
      const isLoggedIn = !!auth?.user;
      const isOnDashboard = nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/dashboard');
      if (isOnDashboard) {
        if (isLoggedIn) return true;
        return false; // Redirect unauthenticated users to login page
      } else if (isLoggedIn) {
        return Response.redirect(new URL('/dashboard', nextUrl));
      }
      return true;
    },
  },
  providers: [], // Add providers with an empty array for now
} satisfies NextAuthConfig;

The authorized callback is used to verify if the request is authorized to access a page via Next.js Middleware. It is called before a request is completed, and it receives an object with the auth and request properties. The auth property contains the user's session, and the request property contains the incoming request.

The providers option is an array where you list different login options. For now, it's an empty array to satisfy NextAuth config. You'll learn more about it in the Adding the Credentials provider section.

Next, you will need to import the authConfig object into a Middleware file. In the root of your project, create a file called middleware.ts and paste the following code:

/middleware.ts
import NextAuth from 'next-auth';
import { authConfig } from './auth.config';
 
export default NextAuth(authConfig).auth;
 
export const config = {
  // https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware#matcher
  matcher: ['/((?!api|_next/static|_next/image|.*\\.png$).*)'],
};

Here you're initializing NextAuth.js with the authConfig object and exporting the auth property. You're also using the matcher option from Middleware to specify that it should run on specific paths.

The advantage of employing Middleware for this task is that the protected routes will not even start rendering until the Middleware verifies the authentication, enhancing both the security and performance of your application.


Password hashing ------>

It's good practice to hash passwords before storing them in a database. Hashing converts a password into a fixed-length string of characters, which appears random, providing a layer of security even if the user's data is exposed.

In your seed.js file, you used a package called bcrypt to hash the user's password before storing it in the database. You will use it again later in this chapter to compare that the password entered by the user matches the one in the database. However, you will need to create a separate file for the bcrypt package. This is because bcrypt relies on Node.js APIs not available in Next.js Middleware.

Create a new file called auth.ts that spreads your authConfig object:

/auth.ts
import NextAuth from 'next-auth';
import { authConfig } from './auth.config';
 
export const { auth, signIn, signOut } = NextAuth({
  ...authConfig,
});

Adding the Credentials provider ------>

Next, you will need to add the providers option for NextAuth.js. providers is an array where you list different login options such as Google or GitHub. For this course, we will focus on using the Credentials provider -https://authjs.dev/getting-started/providers/credentials-tutorial only.

The Credentials provider allows users to log in with a username and a password.

/auth.ts
import NextAuth from 'next-auth';
import { authConfig } from './auth.config';
import Credentials from 'next-auth/providers/credentials';
 
export const { auth, signIn, signOut } = NextAuth({
  ...authConfig,
  providers: [Credentials({})],
});

---
Good to know:
Although we're using the Credentials provider, it's generally recommended to use alternative providers such as OAuth or email providers. See the NextAuth.js docs for a full list of options.
---

Adding the sign in functionality ------>

You can use the authorize function to handle the authentication logic. Similarly to Server Actions, you can use zod to validate the email and password before checking if the user exists in the database:

/auth.ts
import NextAuth from 'next-auth';
import { authConfig } from './auth.config';
import Credentials from 'next-auth/providers/credentials';
import { z } from 'zod';
 
export const { auth, signIn, signOut } = NextAuth({
  ...authConfig,
  providers: [
    Credentials({
      async authorize(credentials) {
        const parsedCredentials = z
          .object({ email: z.string().email(), password: z.string().min(6) })
          .safeParse(credentials);
      },
    }),
  ],
});

After validating the credentials, create a new getUser function that queries the user from the database.

/auth.ts
import NextAuth from 'next-auth';
import Credentials from 'next-auth/providers/credentials';
import { authConfig } from './auth.config';
import { z } from 'zod';
import { sql } from '@vercel/postgres';
import type { User } from '@/app/lib/definitions';
import bcrypt from 'bcrypt';
 
async function getUser(email: string): Promise<User | undefined> {
  try {
    const user = await sql<User>`SELECT * FROM users WHERE email=${email}`;
    return user.rows[0];
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to fetch user:', error);
    throw new Error('Failed to fetch user.');
  }
}
 
export const { auth, signIn, signOut } = NextAuth({
  ...authConfig,
  providers: [
    Credentials({
      async authorize(credentials) {
        const parsedCredentials = z
          .object({ email: z.string().email(), password: z.string().min(6) })
          .safeParse(credentials);
 
        if (parsedCredentials.success) {
          const { email, password } = parsedCredentials.data;
          const user = await getUser(email);
          if (!user) return null;
        }
 
        return null;
      },
    }),
  ],
});

Then, call bcrypt.compare to check if the passwords match:

/auth.ts
import NextAuth from 'next-auth';
import Credentials from 'next-auth/providers/credentials';
import { authConfig } from './auth.config';
import { sql } from '@vercel/postgres';
import { z } from 'zod';
import type { User } from '@/app/lib/definitions';
import bcrypt from 'bcrypt';
 
// ...
 
export const { auth, signIn, signOut } = NextAuth({
  ...authConfig,
  providers: [
    Credentials({
      async authorize(credentials) {
        // ...
 
        if (parsedCredentials.success) {
          const { email, password } = parsedCredentials.data;
          const user = await getUser(email);
          if (!user) return null;
          const passwordsMatch = await bcrypt.compare(password, user.password);
 
          if (passwordsMatch) return user;
        }
 
        console.log('Invalid credentials');
        return null;
      },
    }),
  ],
});

Finally, if the passwords match you want to return the user, otherwise, return null to prevent the user from logging in.

Updating the login form  ------>

Now you need to connect the auth logic with your login form. In your actions.ts file, create a new action called authenticate. This action should import the signIn function from auth.ts:

/app/lib/actions.ts
'use server';
 
import { signIn } from '@/auth';
import { AuthError } from 'next-auth';
 
// ...
 
export async function authenticate(
  prevState: string | undefined,
  formData: FormData,
) {
  try {
    await signIn('credentials', formData);
  } catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof AuthError) {
      switch (error.type) {
        case 'CredentialsSignin':
          return 'Invalid credentials.';
        default:
          return 'Something went wrong.';
      }
    }
    throw error;
  }
}

If there's a 'CredentialsSignin' error, you want to show an appropriate error message. You can learn about NextAuth.js errors in the documentation -https://errors.authjs.dev/

Finally, in your login-form.tsx component, you can use React's useActionState to call the server action, handle form errors, and display the form's pending state:

app/ui/login-form.tsx
'use client';
 
import { lusitana } from '@/app/ui/fonts';
import {
  AtSymbolIcon,
  KeyIcon,
  ExclamationCircleIcon,
} from '@heroicons/react/24/outline';
import { ArrowRightIcon } from '@heroicons/react/20/solid';
import { Button } from '@/app/ui/button';
import { useActionState } from 'react';
import { authenticate } from '@/app/lib/actions';
 
export default function LoginForm() {
  const [errorMessage, formAction, isPending] = useActionState(
    authenticate,
    undefined,
  );
 
  return (
    <form action={formAction} className="space-y-3">
      <div className="flex-1 rounded-lg bg-gray-50 px-6 pb-4 pt-8">
        <h1 className={`${lusitana.className} mb-3 text-2xl`}>
          Please log in to continue.
        </h1>
        <div className="w-full">
          <div>
            <label
              className="mb-3 mt-5 block text-xs font-medium text-gray-900"
              htmlFor="email"
            >
              Email
            </label>
            <div className="relative">

                className="peer block w-full rounded-md border border-gray-200 py-[9px] pl-10 text-sm outline-2 placeholder:text-gray-500"
                id="email"
                type="email"
                name="email"
                placeholder="Enter your email address"
                required
              />
              <AtSymbolIcon className="pointer-events-none absolute left-3 top-1/2 h-[18px] w-[18px] -translate-y-1/2 text-gray-500 peer-focus:text-gray-900" />

              htmlFor="password"
            >
              Password
            </label>
            <div className="relative">
              <input
                className="peer block w-full rounded-md border border-gray-200 py-[9px] pl-10 text-sm outline-2 placeholder:text-gray-500"
                id="password"
                type="password"
                name="password"
                placeholder="Enter password"
                required
                minLength={6}
              />
              <KeyIcon className="pointer-events-none absolute left-3 top-1/2 h-[18px] w-[18px] -translate-y-1/2 text-gray-500 peer-focus:text-gray-900" />

          </div>
        </div>
        <Button className="mt-4 w-full" aria-disabled={isPending}>
          Log in <ArrowRightIcon className="ml-auto h-5 w-5 text-gray-50" />
        </Button>
        <div
          className="flex h-8 items-end space-x-1"
          aria-live="polite"
          aria-atomic="true"
        >
          {errorMessage && (
            <>
              <ExclamationCircleIcon className="h-5 w-5 text-red-500" />
              <p className="text-sm text-red-500">{errorMessage}</p>
            </>
          )}
        </div>
      </div>
    </form>
  );
}


Adding the logout functionality ------>

To add the logout functionality to <SideNav />, call the signOut function from auth.ts in your <form> element:

/ui/dashboard/sidenav.tsx
import Link from 'next/link';
import NavLinks from '@/app/ui/dashboard/nav-links';
import AcmeLogo from '@/app/ui/acme-logo';
import { PowerIcon } from '@heroicons/react/24/outline';
import { signOut } from '@/auth';
 
export default function SideNav() {
  return (
    <div className="flex h-full flex-col px-3 py-4 md:px-2">
      // ...
      <div className="flex grow flex-row justify-between space-x-2 md:flex-col md:space-x-0 md:space-y-2">
        <NavLinks />
        <div className="hidden h-auto w-full grow rounded-md bg-gray-50 md:block"></div>
        <form
          action={async () => {
            'use server';
            await signOut();
          }}
        >
          <button className="flex h-[48px] grow items-center justify-center gap-2 rounded-md bg-gray-50 p-3 text-sm font-medium hover:bg-sky-100 hover:text-blue-600 md:flex-none md:justify-start md:p-2 md:px-3">
            <PowerIcon className="w-6" />
            <div className="hidden md:block">Sign Out</div>
          </button>
        </form>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

Try it out
Now, try it out. You should be able to log in and out of your application using the following credentials:

* Email: user@nextmail.com
* Password: 123456


You've Completed Chapter 15
You added authentication to your application and protected your dashboard routes.



Chapter 16
Adding Metadata


Metadata is crucial for SEO and shareability. In this chapter, we'll discuss how you can add metadata to your Next.js application.

In this chapter...
Here are the topics we’ll cover
(i) What metadata is.
[A] Types of metadata.
[^]How to add an Open Graph image using metadata.
(N) How to add a favicon using metadata.

What is metadata? ------>
In web development, metadata provides additional details about a webpage. Metadata is not visible to the users visiting the page. Instead, it works behind the scenes, embedded within the page's HTML, usually within the <head> element. This hidden information is crucial for search engines and other systems that need to understand your webpage's content better.

Why is metadata important? ------>
Metadata plays a significant role in enhancing a webpage's SEO, making it more accessible and understandable for search engines and social media platforms. Proper metadata helps search engines effectively index webpages, improving their ranking in search results. Additionally, metadata like Open Graph improves the appearance of shared links on social media, making the content more appealing and informative for users.

Types of metadata ------>
There are various types of metadata, each serving a unique purpose. Some common types include:


Title Metadata: Responsible for the title of a webpage that is displayed on the browser tab. It's crucial for SEO as it helps search engines understand what the webpage is about.

<title>Page Title</title>


Description Metadata: This metadata provides a brief overview of the webpage content and is often displayed in search engine results.

<meta name="description" content="A brief description of the page content." />


Keyword Metadata: This metadata includes the keywords related to the webpage content, helping search engines index the page.

<meta name="keywords" content="keyword1, keyword2, keyword3" />


Open Graph Metadata: This metadata enhances the way a webpage is represented when shared on social media platforms, providing information such as the title, description, and preview image.

<meta property="og:title" content="Title Here" />
<meta property="og:description" content="Description Here" />
<meta property="og:image" content="image_url_here" />


Favicon Metadata: This metadata links the favicon (a small icon) to the webpage, displayed in the browser's address bar or tab.

<link rel="icon" href="path/to/favicon.ico" />


Adding metadata ------>
Next.js has a Metadata API that can be used to define your application metadata. There are two ways you can add metadata to your application:

(*) Config-based: Export a static metadata object or a dynamic generateMetadata function in a layout.js or page.js file.

(*) File-based: Next.js has a range of special files that are specifically used for metadata purposes:
* favicon.ico, apple-icon.jpg, and icon.jpg: Utilized for favicons and icons
* opengraph-image.jpg and twitter-image.jpg: Employed for social media images
* robots.txt: Provides instructions for search engine crawling
* sitemap.xml: Offers information about the website's structure

You have the flexibility to use these files for static metadata, or you can generate them programmatically within your project.

With both these options, Next.js will automatically generate the relevant <head> elements for your pages.

Favicon and Open Graph image --
In your /public folder, you'll notice you have two images: favicon.ico and opengraph-image.jpg.

Move these images to the root of your /app folder.

After doing this, Next.js will automatically identify and use these files as your favicon and OG image. You can verify this by checking the <head> element of your application in dev tools.

Good to know: You can also create dynamic OG images using the ImageResponse -https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/image-response constructor.

Page title and descriptions --
You can also include a metadata https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-metadata#metadata-fields object -https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-metadata#metadata-fields from any layout.js or page.js file to add additional page information like title and description. Any metadata in layout.js will be inherited by all pages that use it.

In your root layout, create a new metadata object with the following fields:

/app/layout.tsx
import { Metadata } from 'next';
 
export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: 'Acme Dashboard',

Next.js will automatically add the title and metadata to your application.

But what if you want to add a custom title for a specific page? You can do this by adding a metadata object to the page itself. Metadata in nested pages will override the metadata in the parent.

For example, in the /dashboard/invoices page, you can update the page title:

/app/dashboard/invoices/page.tsx
import { Metadata } from 'next';
 
export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: 'Invoices | Acme Dashboard',
};

This works, but we are repeating the title of the application in every page. If something changes, like the company name, you'd have to update it on every page.

Instead, you can use the title.template field in the metadata object to define a template for your page titles. This template can include the page title, and any other information you want to include.

In your root layout, update the metadata object to include a template:

/app/layout.tsx
import { Metadata } from 'next';
 
export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: {
    template: '%s | Acme Dashboard',
    default: 'Acme Dashboard',
  },
  description: 'The official Next.js Learn Dashboard built with App Router.',
  metadataBase: new URL('https://next-learn-dashboard.vercel.sh'),
};

The %s in the template will be replaced with the specific page title.

Now, in your /dashboard/invoices page, you can add the page title:

/app/dashboard/invoices/page.tsx
export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: 'Invoices',
};

Navigate to the /dashboard/invoices page and check the <head> element. You should see the page title is now Invoices | Acme Dashboard.

Practice: Adding metadata ------>

Now that you've learned about metadata, practice by adding titles to your other pages:

1. /login page.
2. /dashboard/ page.
3. /dashboard/customers page.
4. /dashboard/invoices/create page.
5. /dashboard/invoices/[id]/edit page.

The Next.js Metadata API is powerful and flexible, giving you full control over your application's metadata. Here, we've shown you how to add some basic metadata, but you can add multiple fields, including keywords, robots, canonical, and more. Feel free to explore the documentation, and add any additional metadata you want to your application.

You've Completed Chapter 16
Congratulations! You've added metadata to your application and learned about the Metadata API.
